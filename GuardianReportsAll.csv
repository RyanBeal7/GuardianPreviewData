0,Swansea,Stoke,Fri 11 May 2018 17.23 BST,2017-18,"A match many thought would have so much riding on it a few weeks ago is now effectively a dead rubber. Stoke are already condemned to the Championship and Swansea’s relegation will be confirmed at the final whistle. It promises to be a strange day, with Swansea fans planning to hold protests to vent their anger at the board and also turning up to say farewell to Àngel Rangel and Leon Britton, two club stalwarts. Stoke, like Swansea, will be glad when it is all over. Stuart James"
1,Newcastle United,Chelsea,Fri 11 May 2018 17.06 BST,2017-18,"The consensus suggests this will be Antonio Conte’s last Premier League game in charge of Chelsea. Can he use it to somehow secure a top-four finish? Newcastle fans must trust this is not Rafael Benítez’s Tyneside swansong. The negotiations between their widely coveted manager and Mike Ashley over extending a contract that has only a year to run remain delicate. Expect the Gallowgate End to, not for the first time, repeatedly sing “Rafa Benítez, we want you to stay.” Chelsea meanwhile are monitoring Newcastle’s much improved centre-half Jamaal Lascelles. He could be key to Benítez’s team ending a run of four straight defeats as they struggle to retain their grip on 10th place. Louise Taylor"
2,Tottenham,Leicester,Fri 11 May 2018 16.43 BST,2017-18,"Leicester’s 3-1 win over Arsenal on Wednesday was welcome, not least for Claude Puel but the mutterings continue that the manager is set to be replaced. Before midweek, his team had taken one point from an available 15 but three against Tottenham could drive them to an eighth-placed finish – surely a decent effort? Mauricio Pochettino worries that nothing is ever good enough for some Spurs fans. He wants to make sure of third. David Hytner"
3,Liverpool,Brighton,Fri 11 May 2018 16.33 BST,2017-18,"Complaints over Liverpool’s recent league form have been excessive, given the limited midfield and forward options available to Jürgen Klopp while guiding the club into the Champions League final, but the last day equation is straight-forward on many levels. Preserve an unbeaten home campaign against a Brighton team that has won twice on the road all season and Liverpool are in the Champions League for a second year running. As a side note, Mohamed Salah needs one more goal to become Liverpool’s record scorer in a Premier League campaign. He is currently level with Luis Suárez’s 31 goals in 2013-14. Andy Hunter"
4,Burnley,Bournemouth,Fri 11 May 2018 16.23 BST,2017-18,"Burnley are looking for their first win in five matches, against Bournemouth, but no one really cares about that at Turf Moor. Three points to see out a memorable season would be nice, but Burnley already have a hugely impressive 54 and have put themselves into Europe for the first time since 1967. No one was expecting that, though as a result Burnley will be expecting interest in Sean Dyche to resurface again over summer. “It’s the price of success,” chairman Mike Garlick said. Paul Wilson"
5,Southampton,Manchester City,Fri 11 May 2018 16.07 BST,2017-18,"Manchester City’s quest for 100 points come up against a Southampton side who are all but safe but technically still need a draw, after four away points in a week and with a 10-goal swing required if Swansea finally manage a win. Mark Hughes would give his prospects of staying an added boost with a return against the club who sacked him in 2009 and he has urged Saints to make a quick decision for next season. “It’s a well-run club, good club, and a good opportunity for whoever gets it,” said Hughes who arrived only in March. If City win they will set more records, however, for the most away wins in a Premier League season with 16, and the most points on the road, 50. “In the last few weeks these numbers have helped us keep focus,” said Guardiola, whose players secured the title on 15 April. Mark Tallentire"
6,Manchester United,Watford,Fri 11 May 2018 15.52 BST,2017-18,"Manchester United’s odd league campaign will have them end in second place whatever the result versus Watford despite José Mourinho’s side rarely exciting or convincing. The visitors arrive safe in 13th and could end as high as 10th should they beat United and, given West Brom’s victory at Old Trafford in April, they may fancy their chances. Jamie Jackson"
7,Crystal Palace,West Brom,Fri 11 May 2018 13.57 BST,2017-18,"Two of the division’s form teams meet on the final day, with the occasion little more than a celebration of the two managers. Roy Hodgson’s feat in steering Crystal Palace to safety, despite a chronic injury crisis, having been pointless in mid-October has been remarkable. Darren Moore, even only in his capacity as a caretaker, has mustered 11 points from five matches, claimed the manager of the month award for April and endured relegation on Tuesday. The hope – and it is only a hope as yet – is he is given a chance to take up the reins on a permanent basis. Dominic Fifield"
8,West Ham United,Everton,Fri 11 May 2018 11.56 BST,2017-18,"David Moyes and Sam Allardyce face their former employers knowing that they could both be out of a job soon. Wayne Rooney, who has received an offer from DC United, is unlikely to feature because of a knee injury, so fans may have missed their chance to pay tribute to a legend. Moyes and Allardyce, on the other hand, are unlikely to be mourned if they are shown the door by West Ham and Everton respectively. Jacob Steinberg"
9,Arsenal,Burnley,Sat 5 May 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"This is the big one in terms of Arsène Wenger’s farewell – his final home game and Arsenal have lots planned, including ‘Merci Arsène’ T-shirts for the fans. Burnley will not play the obliging guests. Were they to win, they could end up finishing sixth and squeezing Arsenal into seventh. Both clubs would enter the Europa League but Arsenal would begin in a qualifier on 26 July – currently the date of their first pre-season friendly against Atlético Madrid in Singapore. David Hytner"
10,Chelsea,Liverpool,Sat 5 May 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Liverpool will arrive on a high with thoughts already fixed on the Champions League final later this month, but Chelsea could technically draw level on points with the team currently third should they win their next two fixtures. Antonio Conte’s side are clinging to the remote possibility of a top four finish, though the Italian did say Sunday’s game “could be a good opportunity to keep the hope alive”. They have belatedly found some form of sorts, with four wins in a row in all competitions. Liverpool can ill afford to be distracted. Dominic Fifield"
11,Manchester City,Huddersfield Town,Sat 5 May 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"On Saturday Manchester City will finally get their hands on the Premier League trophy, two weeks after claiming the crown. As always Pep Guardiola will ask his players to maintain focus as the manager’s intent is that every opposition should be blown away as West Ham were last Sunday. Huddersfield are three points above the drop zone so even a draw would be important for David Wagner’s side. Jamie Jackson"
12,Stoke City,Crystal Palace,Fri 4 May 2018 17.12 BST,2017-18,"It is do or die time for Stoke. A fourth successive draw would not be enough: Paul Lambert’s side must win this match if they are to have any chance of going into their final match of the campaign with survival still possible. Crystal Palace, though technically not safe yet, arrive in buoyant mood thanks to last week’s thrashing of Leicester. Paul Doyle"
13,West Brom,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 4 May 2018 16.33 BST,2017-18,"West Bromwich Albion have to win against Tottenham and if successful they must rely on Swansea losing again to avoid relegation for another week. This feels highly unlikely, despite Darren Moore’s positive influence on the Baggies, as West Brom last beat Tottenham at the Hawthorns in 2008. Maurico Pochettino’s side are yet to secure a place in the Champions League next season and will be hungry to edge even closer to another crack at Europe’s elite with victory. Graham Searles"
14,Watford,Newcastle United,Fri 4 May 2018 16.22 BST,2017-18,"Watford facing Newcastle is certainly not the most tantalising fixture of the weekend but there is still intrigue regarding the future of the respective managers. Javi Gracia has the potential to guide Watford to their best Premier League finish, as they sit level with their previous record in 13th, but their run of seven matches without a win will not have pleased the trigger-happy powers that be. Rafa Benítez has hinted, again, that he is prepared to move on if his masterful season is not rewarded with investment in the squad. Graham Searles"
15,Leicester City,West Ham United,Fri 4 May 2018 16.06 BST,2017-18,"If there was ever a good time for West Ham to be travelling to the King Power Stadium, then this is surely it. Leicester have won only four of their previous 18 league games, they were booed off in the last home match and go into this fixture off the back of a 5-0 defeat at Crystal Palace with a long injury list. It has not exactly been plain-sailing lately for West Ham either but Andy Carroll is set to be involved after patching up his differences with David Moyes. Stuart James"
16,Bournemouth,Swansea City,Fri 4 May 2018 15.53 BST,2017-18,Swansea are in trouble. Carlos Carvalhal’s side are just a point above the relegation zone and crucially their momentum disappeared. Bournemouth should have a chance at turning their own abject streak around as Swansea have scored just two goals and are winless in their past seven games in all competitions. Carvalhal will be counting on fear of the dreaded drop to provide all the motivation his side need to keep their heads above water. Graham Searles
17,Everton,Southampton,Fri 4 May 2018 15.40 BST,2017-18,"Southampton have three games to save their skins and leaving aside Tuesday’s trip to Swansea for a six-pointer, this is the other one in which they really need a return as they host Manchester City on the final day and that may be too tall an order. Last week’s win against Bournemouth was only their second in 10 league games but it gave the fans hope and Mark Hughes will be looking to capitalise on that during the trip to Goodison, where the atmosphere has been eerily quiet of late. Sam Allardyce, like Hughes another merry-go-round perennial to take over in the dugout since Saints defeated Everton 4-1 in October’s reverse fixture, reckons he has won “the hearts and minds” of the Everton majority with their home performances and insists the dissenters are a vocal minority. Some were evident when Everton won their last home game, against Newcastle, with their only shot on target, but many were more so during the 2-0 win at Huddersfield later that week. With Allardyce already talking about his plans for the close season, some may even welcome the chance to clear their throats and get the banners out if Hughes produces the away win Saints crave. Mark Tallentire"
18,Tottenham Hotspur,Watford,Sun 29 Apr 2018 08.59 BST,2017-18,"Tottenham, devastated by their FA Cup semi-final defeat against Manchester United last week, must bounce back to maintain their advantage over Chelsea chasing in fifth place, who on Monday may be two points behind Spurs, by taking all three against out-out-form Watford. Javi Gracia’s side, winless since the beginning of March, are struggling with injuries. Troy Deeney and Roberto Pereyra are both major doubts for the trip to Wembley. Joel Aberg"
19,West Ham United,Manchester City,Sat 28 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Another victory will move Manchester City one win away from setting a new points record in the Premier League. The champions look determined to keep standards high and they scored nine goals in two visits to the London Stadium last season. They will fancy their chances against West Ham, who are still not safe from relegation after last weekend’s thrashing at Arsenal. David Moyes’s team will require a perfect defensive performance to stand any chance of denying City. Jacob Steinberg"
20,Manchester United,Arsenal,Sat 28 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Relations between José Mourinho and Arsène Wenger have eased recently yet how Manchester United fans might greet the Arsenal manager, for so long their bete noire, as he walks out at Old Trafford will intrigue, given the Frenchman is leaving the Gunners. On the pitch United will hope to claim another win in the bid for second place: Arsenal, of course, want to prevent that. Jamie Jackson"
21,Burnley,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 27 Apr 2018 16.23 BST,2017-18,"Burnley’s dream of playing in the Europa League is still alive despite the fact they have fallen short in consecutive Premier League games. Sean Dyche’s side have suffered just one defeat from their past eight games, and will prove to be a difficult task for a Brighton side who have struggled away from home this season. Chris Hughton’s men are winless since their back-to-back successes against Swansea and Arsenal in early March. Joel Aberg"
22,Newcastle United,West Brom,Fri 27 Apr 2018 16.13 BST,2017-18,"Darren Moore has presided over the collection of five points from three games since assuming caretaker charge of West Brom but he could still see his side’s long inevitable relegation confirmed on Saturday night. Meanwhile Rafa Benítez has announced that talks over his future on Tyneside are under way. Newcastle’s manager has only a year left on his contract and will want assurances as to the summer transfer budget before extending it. “We’ve had conversations and we’ll have more conversations next week,” said Benítez before stressing that a quick resolution would be “better for everybody”. Louise Taylor"
23,Swansea City,Chelsea,Fri 27 Apr 2018 15.57 BST,2017-18,"There is plenty at stake for both clubs as Chelsea pursue the three points that would keep alive hopes of a top-four finish while Swansea chase the victory that would give their survival prospects a huge boost. Swansea have collected 13 points from their past five home games, beating Liverpool and Arsenal in the process, but they have injury problems at the back, with Federico Fernández and Kyle Bartley doubtful. Chelsea, who are looking for a third successive away win in the league, are still without the suspended Marcos Alonso. Stuart James"
24,Crystal Palace,Leicester City,Fri 27 Apr 2018 15.39 BST,2017-18,"Victory against Leicester City would hoist Crystal Palace to 38 points and the verge of top-flight safety. Claude Puel’s side will arrive at Selhurst Park having won only twice in 10 league games stretching back to January, without Kasper Schmeichel, and with the manager’s job beyond this season in doubt. Yet Roy Hodgson is still preaching caution in a bid to ward off any complacency. Palace, much improved, have lost only once to a side outside the top eight since September and must determine whether the time is apt to recall Christian Benteke. Dominic Fifield"
25,Huddersfield,Everton,Fri 27 Apr 2018 15.12 BST,2017-18,"Everton, following their win against in-form Newcastle, travel to Huddersfield and are eyeing a second successive win. David Wagner’s side, six points above the relegation zone, have taken 25 from a maximum 35 points at home this season, in comparison to Everton’s 12 from 45 on the road. Gylfi Sigurdsson is back in light training, but the Everton manager, Sam Allardyce, said the Iceland international is still “a way off” making a first-team return anytime soon. Joel Aberg"
26,Southampton,Bournemouth,Fri 27 Apr 2018 13.38 BST,2017-18,"Southampton’s situation remains dire but there is still a potential escape route open to Mark Hughes’s side. With matches against Everton and relegation rivals Swansea following this, they have the chance to make up ground before the final-day visit of Manchester City. Hughes will be without playmaker Sofiane Boufal – he is training with the youth team after falling out with the manager. Eddie Howe will still be unable to call upon Adam Smith, who is close to a return, as his visiting side look to assert their south-coast supremacy. Niall McVeigh"
27,Liverpool,Stoke City,Fri 27 Apr 2018 13.14 BST,2017-18,"Paul Lambert has overseen three wins at Liverpool in his managerial career, the most recent with Wolves in the FA Cup last season, but now must accomplish what no other Stoke manager in history has done to bring hope to the club’s relegation fight. Stoke have never won a top flight league game at Anfield and Jürgen Klopp’s side are unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season. The Liverpool manager must rotate before next week’s second leg against Roma and the visitors simply have to capitalise with only three matches of their season remaining. Andy Hunter"
28,Everton,Newcastle,Sun 22 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Rafael Benítez’s in-form Newcastle can leapfrog Everton with a fifth consecutive league victory. The onus will be on Jonjo Shelvey to show the watching Gareth Southgate that he is worth considering, and trusting, for a late inclusion in England’s World Cup squad. For Sam Allardyce, the visit of his former club brings reminders of an unhappy spell at St James’ Park and a massive pay-off. With Evertonians calling for something similar at Swansea last weekend, albeit in harsher terms, he could do with another home win to keep the restless supporters at bay. Andy Hunter"
29,Arsenal,West Ham United,Sat 21 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Arsène Wenger’s farewell to Arsenal begins against West Ham. A first opportunity for the fans to show just how much he has meant to the club over the past 22 years before the pressure of hosting Atlético Madrid on Thursday. What influence, if any, could the news of Wenger’s departure have on his side? The Emirates faithful will be hoping to be transported back to the glory days but West Ham are not safe yet. Survival instincts may prevail on Sunday. Graham Searles"
30,Chelsea,Southampton,Sat 21 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Chelsea and Southampton met last weekend in the Premier League and the suspicion lingers that Southampton, a side languishing in the bottom three, who had been dominant in establishing a two-goal lead at St Mary’s, may not recover from their capitulation in the last 20 minutes of that fixture. Chelsea, denied the banned Marcos Alonso but bolstered further by their win at Turf Moor on Thursday, will hope to dominate with the excellent Eden Hazard, Willian and Olivier Giroud at Wembley as they seek a trophy from a season mired in anticlimax. Dominic Fifield"
31,Manchester City,Swansea,Sat 21 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Manchester City will stride out before their adoring crowd as freshly-crowned champions knowing five wins from the final five matches will take them to 102 points and eclipse Chelsea’s record Premier League tally of 95. Pep Guardiola, though, will look to see how his charges react to their new status so, while Swansea will expect a long afternoon, as they are fighting relegation, Carlos Carvalhal’s side may not be a walkover. Jamie Jackson"
32,Stoke City,Burnley,Sat 21 Apr 2018 08.59 BST,2017-18,"Stoke have left it very late to start a surge for safety, and if it does not begin against Burnley, it will probably not materialise at all. Scoring has been a problem for Stoke all season so they will have taken some encouragement from the fact that Burnley looked uncharacteristically leaky while losing 2-1 to Chelsea on Thursday. Then again, Stoke are no Chelsea. Paul Doyle"
33,Man Utd,Spurs,Fri 20 Apr 2018 15.27 BST,2017-18,This is it for Manchester United and Tottenham Hotspur as José Mourinho and Mauricio Pochettino’s men hope to reach the FA Cup final and claim an all-important trophy. Mourinho would detest failing to earn silverware and Pochettino has never won anything in a nine-year managerial career. Each manager will be intent on reaching May’s Wembley showpiece. Jamie Jackson
34,West Bromwich Albion,Liverpool,Fri 20 Apr 2018 13.32 BST,2017-18,"Can West Brom cause another upset? With Jürgen Klopp surely focused on Roma at Anfield on Tuesday and Champions League football next season all but secured, it is a possibility. However it does feel like rather a large stretch of the imagination for the bumbling Baggies to best Liverpool despite needing to win to maintain their already incredibly slender hopes of staying up. Mohamed Salah alone has scored more league goals this season than Darren Moore’s side. Graham Searles"
35,Watford,Crystal Palace,Fri 20 Apr 2018 11.45 BST,2017-18,"Watford are in danger of being drawn into the relegation battle if they record a fifth defeat from six against Crystal Palace. Roy Hodson’s side will draw level with them, and take a huge step towards safety, if they do. Hodgson should be confident after Palace flourished in attack to beat Brighton last week. Four Watford players may miss out with a stomach virus too. Javi Gracia has not named two of the ill players which suggests he is not feeling confident about his side’s chances. Graham Searles"
36,West Ham United,Stoke City,Sun 15 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"West Ham have responded well after last month’s chaotic defeat against Burnley at the London Stadium, thrashing Southampton and drawing at Chelsea to move three points above the bottom three. They are not out of the woods yet, though. One more win might be enough, but Stoke are also desperate for points and it is bound to be a tense battle on Monday night. Jacob Steinberg"
37,Newcastle United,Arsenal,Sat 14 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,The long journey back from Moscow means Arsène Wenger is likely to rest many of his first-choice players for the trip north to Newcastle. Rafa Benítez’s side are aiming to record a fourth successive victory but have failed to pick up a single point against Arsenal since a 0-0 draw in 2011 – a run of 10 matches. Ed Aarons
38,Manchester United,West Bromwich Albion,Sat 14 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"All Manchester United can do is keep winning while praying Manchester City perform a flop of Devon Loch proportions. They should have no problems cuffing aside West Brom, but if Pep Guardiola’s men have already won at Tottenham on Saturday it will be close to immaterial. Still, second place is definitely on for José Mourinho’s men and that would represent a four-place leap from last season. Jamie Jackson"
39,Huddersfield Town,Watford,Fri 13 Apr 2018 18.34 BST,2017-18,"Huddersfield host Watford conscious that anything other than a win leaves them at risk of getting dragged into the relegation dogfight with four games to play. Those final four matches consist of trips to Chelsea and Manchester City, as well as hosting Everton and Arsenal. “It feels like before [last season] in the play-offs,” said David Wagner, the Huddersfield manager. “Everyone wanted to find out where it ends.” Watford have not scored away from home since 2 January but if they can register one in west Yorkshire, they may just put the seal on Premier League survival. Ben Fisher"
40,Swansea City,Everton,Fri 13 Apr 2018 17.28 BST,2017-18,"A huge game for Swansea, who could take a significant step towards survival if they can rack up a fifth successive home win. Jordan Ayew, Swansea’s leading goalscorer, returns from suspension and will go straight back into the team, possibly at the expense of Tammy Abraham. For Everton, Wayne Rooney is expected to start, with Sam Allardyce insisting there is no problem between them after he substituted the forward last weekend, but there will be no Liberty Stadium return for Gylfi Sigurdsson, who remains injured. Stuart James"
41,Tottenham Hotspur,Manchester City,Fri 13 Apr 2018 16.55 BST,2017-18,"Pep Guardiola goes to Wembley looking to avoid a fourth successive defeat for only the second time in his managerial career – if City win and Manchester United lose on Sunday, the league title is theirs. With a top four place almost secured, Tottenham should provide a stiff test having won the corresponding fixture 2-0 last January. Ed Aarons"
42,Southampton,Chelsea,Fri 13 Apr 2018 15.41 BST,2017-18,"In the corresponding fixture last season, Diego Costa sealed a hard-fought win that showed Chelsea’s title credentials to end Southampton’s long unbeaten run at home. That was only 18 months ago. Both teams have unravelled this season and head into a league and cup double-header wondering where another defeat will leave them. Southampton’s plight is more pressing and with five tricky-looking fixtures to follow, Mark Hughes must aim for better than the narrow defeat to Arsenal. He will be without the suspended Jack Stephens but at least has in-form strikers to choose from – Charlie Austin and Shane Long both scored at the Emirates, with Long expected to recover from an ankle problem. Niall McVeigh"
43,Burnley,Leicester City,Fri 13 Apr 2018 15.06 BST,2017-18,"Sean Dyche was briefly linked with the Leicester job when it became vacant early in the season, mainly because of his Midlands connections, and Saturday’s visitors to Turf Moor might consider that a chance missed now that Burnley are likely to end up in Europe. Six points currently separates the two sides, a gap that could easily increase as Burnley enjoy the luxury of good home form and a stress-free run-in. Paul Wilson"
44,Liverpool,Bournemouth,Fri 13 Apr 2018 14.02 BST,2017-18,"The Champions League semi-final dominates Liverpool’s thoughts but Jürgen Klopp wants a top-four finish in the Premier League secured as quickly as possible. Mohamed Salah requires one more league goal to reach 30 for the season, and has scored 11 times in his last six matches at Anfield, but his game-time may be restricted against Bournemouth after he returned from a groin problem to play a starring role in the midweek European defeat of Manchester City. Liverpool need three more goals to record 300 in all competitions under Klopp. Andy Hunter"
45,Crystal Palace,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 13 Apr 2018 13.40 BST,2017-18,"Roy Hodgson has a choice to make up front with Christian Benteke and Alexander Sørlorth fit enough to feature, albeit after Andros Townsend and Wilfried Zaha impressed at Bournemouth. This team’s greatest shortcoming this season has been up front where analysis by Gracenote Sports, taking into account the quality and frequency of chances created, suggests they should have plundered 52 goals, rather than their measly 33. Benteke’s projected goal tally was 12. He has two. Brighton, relatively solid all season, will seek to blunt their bitter rivals and hope their hosts depart pining for Glenn Murray. Dominic Fifield"
46,Arsenal,Southampton,Sat 7 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Arsenal, as usual, have begun performing since pressure has been relieved from their league campaign. Helpfully their 4-1 demolition of CSKA Moscow on Thursday also makes the trip to Russia next week much more appealing than it might have been. Arsène Wenger’s side should be in relaxed mood and able to fire on all cylinders. Southampton’s chances of securing a much-needed win look bleak after failing to score in their past three league matches. Graham Searles"
47,Chelsea,West Ham United,Sat 7 Apr 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Stamford Bridge will bid an emotional farewell to Ray Wilkins before a derby which will test both teams’ resolve. Chelsea suffered a fourth home defeat of the campaign last weekend, rendering their pursuit of the top four forlorn, and they may have surrendered their title by kick-off. These are difficult times for Antonio Conte. West Ham were buoyed by that restorative thrashing of Southampton, but are hardly clear of the relegation scrap just yet as they pursue a first win across the capital since September 2002. Dominic Fifield"
48,Watford,Burnley,Fri 6 Apr 2018 17.10 BST,2017-18,"Burnley are flying in seventh and catching sixth-placed Arsenal, who are more focused on Europa League activities, is still a realistic proposition. Ashley Barnes’ contribution of four goals in four has been a huge part of their recent success and that could well continue because Watford have conceded 10 goals in their past three matches. Javi Gracia will be looking for his side to build on their improved showing last week against Bournemouth with a win that would equal their points tally last season. Graham Searles"
49,Brighton & Hove Albion,Huddersfield Town,Fri 6 Apr 2018 16.40 BST,2017-18,"After appearing virtually safe after beating Arsenal, successive defeats have restored the element of doubt to Brighton. Their run-in looks brutal after this match against Huddersfield, who are three points and three places below them, and anything but a return to their most convincing home form may set nerves jangling again. Chris Hughton has said the pressure is on but he will be aware Huddersfield, who now look in serious trouble and have a similarly tough end to the season, have not scored in their past four games. Nick Ames"
50,Manchester City,Manchester United,Fri 6 Apr 2018 16.22 BST,2017-18,The timing of the 176th derby could not be better as Manchester City have a priceless chance to claim a fifth league title against their fiercest rivals at home. If City pull this off then their players will become legends and those in the Manchester United side will be constantly reminded of their unwanted part in Mancunian history. It should be some match at the Etihad Stadium. Jamie Jackson
51,Leicester City,Newcastle United,Fri 6 Apr 2018 15.56 BST,2017-18,"Newcastle will arrive in confident mood after climbing to 12th in the table on the back of a fine run of form that has seen them lose only twice in the league since the turn of the year. With 35 points on the board, another victory would all but secure their Premier League status. Leicester remain hopeful of finishing the season in seventh, although Claude Puel will have to rejig his midfield after losing Matty James to injury and Wilfred Ndidi to suspension. Stuart James"
52,West Bromwich Albion,Swansea City,Fri 6 Apr 2018 15.23 BST,2017-18,Swansea will be feeling much better about visiting the Hawthorns than their trip to Old Trafford last week. Carlos Carvalhal’s mission to save the club can get back on track against West Bromwich Albion who are now 11 points adrift with six games to play. However who knows what change Alan Pardew’s exit could bring. The relief for the players of a manager’s tactics that were failing absolutely could be enough to inspire an unlikely victory despite survival hopes approaching the academic stage. Graham Searles
53,Everton,Liverpool,Fri 6 Apr 2018 14.47 BST,2017-18,Sam Allardyce has blamed a small minority on Twitter and Instagram for the negative reaction towards his reign as Everton manager but dissent may be widespread and within ear-shot at Goodison Park should his team repeat their feeble effort against Manchester City in the 231st Merseyside derby. Everton are enduring the worst run in their history against Liverpool – 16 derbies without a win – and while confidence and form is soaring on the other side of Stanley Park Jürgen Klopp must ring the changes before next week’s Champions League rematch at the Etihad Stadium. Andy Hunter
54,Stoke City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 6 Apr 2018 13.47 BST,2017-18,"Stoke have six matches in which to save themselves from relegation and the portents are inauspicious.Paul Lambert has had a host of problems to address before the visit of Tottenham, including Saido Berahino’s time-keeping, Ibrahim Afellay’s attitude and an interview in which Xherdan Shaqiri was quoted bemoaning the lack of quality at Stoke. That is hardly the ideal preparation for Spurs, who have beaten Stoke by four goals in their past four meetings. Lambert has introduced a little more solidity since replacing Mark Hughes but they still do not look capable of a clean sheet. Paul Doyle"
55,Bournemouth,Crystal Palace,Fri 6 Apr 2018 13.32 BST,2017-18,Crystal Palace need to move on from their unlucky defeat against Liverpool last time out despite the mental struggle of winning only once in their past nine matches. Roy Hodgson’s side may have received a blessing in disguise though through Christian Benteke’s lack of fitness. The Belgian striker has scored only two goals this season. Someone else having a chance to be the focal point of Palace’s attack could be the difference between survival and relegation. Bournemouth look safe but Eddie Howe remains focused on not letting up until his side’s Premier League status is confirmed. Graham Searles
56,Chelsea,Tottenham Hotspur,Sat 31 Mar 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Chelsea have won only three of nine league games this year, with Antonio Conte having acknowledged Tottenham must be beaten if they are to reach the top four. They will fret over whether Thibaut Courtois and Andreas Christensen will be involved, while taking comfort in the knowledge Spurs, who have suffered one domestic defeat since November, have not won at Stamford Bridge since February 1990 and could be without Harry Kane. This has the makings of a tense occasion. Dominic Fifield"
57,Arsenal,Stoke City,Sat 31 Mar 2018 09.00 BST,2017-18,"This is a bigger game for Stoke than Arsenal, with the home team having one eye on Thursday’s Europa League tie against CSKA Moscow. Stoke are winless in seven and have scored only four goals during that sequence; the lack of cutting edge – together with individual errors – has undermined some fighting football. The run-in feels unkind, although they do have West Ham, Crystal Palace and Swansea to come. Anything from this would be a huge bonus. David Hytner"
58,Newcastle United,Huddersfield Town,Fri 30 Mar 2018 15.43 BST,2017-18,"The lesser spotted Islam Slimani is set to make his Newcastle debut at some point during this relegation battle featuring two of last season’s promoted sides. Algeria’s Slimani arrived on Tyneside for a £2m loan deal by private jet from Leicester in January but has been sidelined by a thigh injury. Expect Rafael Benítez to start him on the bench. Newcastle have enjoyed a break in Alicante and, by way of return, their manager has asked for an “early goal” and a “high-tempo start”. Louise Taylor"
59,Everton,Manchester City,Fri 30 Mar 2018 15.28 BST,2017-18,"Everton are the only current Premier League team Pep Guardiola has not beaten as the Manchester City manager and there cannot be greater incentive to complete the set than the prize on the horizon that would follow a victory at Goodison Park. Three points will offer City the priceless opportunity of winning the Premier League title at home to Manchester United next weekend. It is an opportunity not to be wasted, although Wednesday’s Champions League quarter-final at Liverpool may influence Guardiola’s selection. Sam Allardyce’s side are unbeaten at home since New Year’s Day. Andy Hunter"
60,Brighton & Hove Albion,Leicester City,Fri 30 Mar 2018 15.20 BST,2017-18,"Both sides can, to all intents and purposes, just go out and play although Leicester could conceivably wonder whether a kind-looking run of games can heave them into faint contention for sixth place. Chris Hughton does not quite see Brighton’s position that way and hopes their next two games against Huddersfield and Crystal Palace banish any lingering relegation concerns. The omens look good: they have won their past four home matches in all competitions and pack a far greater punch in attack than earlier in the season. Nick Ames"
61,West Bromwich Albion,Burnley,Fri 30 Mar 2018 14.55 BST,2017-18,"Burnley are one of only three sides to lose to West Brom in the league this season, a 1-0 win in August giving the visitors an improbable six points from six at that stage. Much has changed since and Burnley have a club-record 43 Premier League points while West Brom are 10 adrift of safety and all but relegated. “I kind of feel I owe this club,” said Alan Pardew, who has only one league win to his name since arriving at the Hawthorns in late November. “The results since I’ve been here should have been better and I’d like to come back next season with a squad that better reflects the way I play, with a bit more attacking prowess.” Burnley have won their last two games – Everton and West Ham – and with only 14 away goals conceded will be disappointed if they do not make it three in a row. Mark Tallentire"
62,West Ham United,Southampton,Fri 30 Mar 2018 14.46 BST,2017-18,"West Ham will be praying there is no repeat of the scenes that marred their 3-0 defeat against Burnley at the London Stadium three weeks ago. They have not played since then and extra security measures will be in place for the visit of Southampton, who will push 17th-placed West Ham into the bottom three if they win. Mark Hughes has said he wants to use the crowd against the home team. Jacob Steinberg"
63,Manchester United,Swansea City,Fri 30 Mar 2018 14.15 BST,2017-18,"Manchester United’s race – for second place and respectability – resumes with the visit of Swansea managed by Carlos Carvalhal, who has inspired his side to build a three-point gap above the relegation zone. Next up for United is Manchester City when Pep Guardiola’s side could claim the title at the Etihad. To have any chance of avoiding that prospect Swansea must be beaten, so José Mourinho will not be short of motivation. Jamie Jackson"
64,Watford,Bournemouth,Fri 30 Mar 2018 12.38 BST,2017-18,"Watford may have just about recovered from being ripped apart by Mohamed Salah before the international break. Javi Gracia will demand a response against Bournemouth, after conceding eight and failing to score in their past two matches on the road, but equally should have confidence in his side’s ability to bounce back based on their strong home record this season. Richarlison’s lack of form is a concern though. The Brazilian scored his first goal for Watford against Eddie Howe’s side in August but has failed to find the net since November. Graham Searles"
65,Crystal Palace,Liverpool,Fri 30 Mar 2018 11.32 BST,2017-18,"Liverpool can move 10 points clear of fifth-placed Chelsea with a win at Selhurst Park, but will be wary that the ailing champions have two games in hand and are still to host them this season. That should spur Jürgen Klopp’s side on, even with this a nuisance of a game before the more anticipated contests against Manchester City and Everton to come. Palace, with their ranks of wounded still too numerous for comfort, will hope Christian Benteke and Mamadou Sakho have points to prove against their former club. Dominic Fifield"
66,Leicester,Chelsea,Sat 17 Mar 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"An intriguing tie that brings together two clubs who have had contrasting experiences in Spain this week. While Leicester’s players enjoyed some warm-weather training in Marbella, Chelsea were being given the run around by Lionel Messi in Barcelona. That Champions League exit means it is the FA Cup or bust for Chelsea this season, and getting to the semi-finals will be no easy task. Leicester were unlucky not to win when the clubs met at Stamford Bridge two months ago and last week’s 4-1 win at West Brom was a timely confidence boost. Stuart James"
67,Wigan,Southampton,Sat 17 Mar 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Wigan, after shocking Manchester City in the previous round of the FA Cup, should be confident they can beat Southampton and reach the semi-finals. Mark Hughes’s appointment, though, will surely give struggling Saints a lift after the end of Mauricio Pellegrino’s stagnant stint. Sparks could, and hopefully will, fly as Paul Cook goes toe-to-toe with another fiery big-name manager. Graham Searles"
68,Huddersfield Town,Crystal Palace,Fri 16 Mar 2018 17.42 GMT,2017-18,Wilfried Zaha is likely to start for Crystal Palace against Huddersfield after recovering from injury and the fleet-footed attacker could be crucial to his side’s chances of ending a winless run of seven matches. Respite from the relegation zone awaits if they are able to. David Wagner will believe his side can continue punching above their weight and at worst not surrender any ground to their relegation rivals with a draw. Graham Searles
69,Stoke City,Everton,Fri 16 Mar 2018 16.59 GMT,2017-18,"Sam Allardyce takes Everton to struggling Stoke, whom they beat 1-0 on the opening day with a debut goal from Wayne Rooney when both teams were under different management, with five successive defeats on their recent travels, his last point coming when the team were outplayed in a 0-0 by West Bromwich Albion. “We’ve been using some more work into the mind in the analysis room. Who we are, what we want to achieve, what we can get,” Allardyce said. Stoke, who lost their free-hit to Manchester City 2-0 on Monday, see this as a match they can and must get three points from and with games running out, will be confident they have the wherewithal to further bamboozle Everton. Mark Tallentire"
70,Man Utd,Brighton,Fri 16 Mar 2018 16.22 GMT,2017-18,"Manchester United’s and José Mourinho’s trophy-winning hopes come down to the FA Cup and so a Brighton side, beaten by a Lewis Dunk own goal in November’s league fixture, must be dispatched to keep the season alive. As Tuesday’s Champions League defeat to Sevilla showed, though, United are vulnerable in knockout games, meaning Chris Hughton may quietly fancy his chances of a shock. Jamie Jackson"
71,Swansea,Spurs,Fri 16 Mar 2018 16.00 GMT,2017-18,"Carlos Carvalhal, Swansea’s manager, has a way with words and it was interesting to hear him say that if Tottenham lose this game it will be “like the end of the world” for them. Tottenham’s progress under Mauricio Pochettino is there for all to see but sooner or later he needs to win a trophy, with the FA Cup their only chance of silverware this season. Spurs will have to do without Harry Kane, although Swansea’s list of absentees is much longer and leaves them desperately short of attacking options. Stuart James"
72,Liverpool,Watford,Fri 16 Mar 2018 14.13 GMT,2017-18,Liverpool will be eager to return to winning ways against Watford and open up a seven-point gap over Chelsea in fifth place. Jürgen Klopp’s side were undone by mistakes at Old Trafford last week and the manager could make changes as he searches for a more sturdy defensive combination that could help guide Liverpool past Manchester City in the Champions League quarter-finals in April. Graham Searles
73,Bournemouth,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 16 Mar 2018 13.24 GMT,2017-18,"West Bromwich Albion’s time in the Premier League appears to be reaching an inevitable conclusion after another defeat, against Leicester, last week. A seventh in succession feels likely for Alan Pardew’s side, despite Gareth Barry and Jonny Evans returning, and a win for Bournemouth would give them one of the three required to confirm a fourth season in the top flight. Is there a risk of complacency for Bournemouth? “Absolutely no chance,” said Eddie Howe. Graham Searles"
74,Bournemouth,Tottenham Hotspur,Sat 10 Mar 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Bournemouth become the first team to take on a wounded Tottenham who are nevertheless undefeated in 11 league games and desperate to take another step towards qualifying for the Champions League for the third season in a row. “The competition doesn’t wait for you,” said the manager, Mauricio Pochettino, reflecting on their calamitous midweek loss to Juventus. “If you’re happy or sad, the team has to move on and think about the weekend.” Bournemouth have been doing little else since their draw at Leicester last time out, with Jermain Defoe, scorer of 91 league goals for Spurs, likely to be on the bench again. “Since Christmas we have been very strong and have beaten some big teams here,” said the manager Eddie Howe, who would probably be delighted with a point this time. Mark Tallentire"
75,Stoke City,Manchester City,Sat 10 Mar 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Stoke, under Mark Hughes, were humiliated 7-2 by Manchester City back in October with six different Citizens finding the net. However while Pep Guardiola’s side are the heavy favourites to win again – a repeated destruction is unlikely. Paul Lambert has brought back Stoke’s once-lauded defensive stability. They have conceded four in six games with the Scot in charge compared to 50 in the 23 preceding games this season, which provides hope in more important fixtures to come. Graham Searles"
76,Arsenal,Watford,Sat 10 Mar 2018 08.59 GMT,2017-18,"Arsenal showed ‘cojones’ in the Europa League win at Milan on Thursday – something the Watford captain, Troy Deeney, accused them of lacking at Vicarage Road in October. Arsène Wenger’s players might want to prove a point to him but, really, the oomph has been knocked from their Premier League season. It is now the Europa League or bust. Watford have won three out of their past four matches. As ever, the mood at the Emirates will be a sub-plot. David Hytner"
77,West Ham United,Burnley,Fri 9 Mar 2018 23.04 GMT,2017-18,"It had gone a little unnoticed that before the win over Everton last Saturday Burnley had gone 11 Premier League games and almost three months without a win. If Sean Dyche’s side can also triumph at West Ham on Saturday they can move to within two points of sixth-placed Arsenal. Joe Hart, meanwhile, has been thrown a World Cup lifeline by David Moyes. The goalkeeper’s England spot for this summer’s tournament in Russia has been in jeopardy since he lost his place at West Ham in December following some inconsistent performances. But Moyes said: “Joe Hart will start.” Paul Chronnell"

80,Chelsea,Crystal Palace,Fri 9 Mar 2018 14.55 GMT,2017-18,"The ailing champions have long been spying this match as potential relief in amid games with Barcelona and the two Manchester clubs, but they have lost to Crystal Palace at Stamford Bridge in each of the last two seasons. This match may come too soon for Wilfried Zaha to start for Palace but he has been the scourge of Chelsea in recent times. The hosts, with four defeats in their past five league games and Wednesday’s trip to Camp Nou looming large, will hope to have the job done before Zaha can be summoned from the bench. Dominic Fifield"
81,Everton,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 9 Mar 2018 14.40 GMT,2017-18,"Sam Allardyce struck a more conciliatory tone before a game he described as arguably the biggest of his brief Everton reign, conscious that bridge-building is needed with supporters who made their feelings clear towards him at Burnley. Goodison Park may well be hostile – “We are absolutely aware of that,” Allardyce said – but there is also need for unity, however temporary, with Stoke away, Manchester City and Liverpool on the horizon. Brighton have the capacity to increase Allardyce’s problems. Chris Hughton’s side are unbeaten in seven games and are above their big-spending opponents in the table. Andy Hunter"
82,Huddersfield Town,Swansea City,Fri 9 Mar 2018 14.24 GMT,2017-18,"Level on points going into the game, Huddersfield and Swansea will view this as a clash that can help pull them farther away from the relegation zone. Swansea, who were walloped 4-1 at Brighton in their last away match, are likely to start cautiously while Huddersfield will look to make home advantage count. The return to fitness of Aaron Mooy could tilt the game in their favour. Paul Doyle"
83,West Brom,Leicester City,Fri 9 Mar 2018 12.26 GMT,2017-18,"West Bromwich Albion’s time in the Premier League appears to be running out with Alan Pardew’s side eight points from safety with nine games to play. A run of five successive defeats speaks for itself but they have performed miracles to stay in the league before. Leicester, though, will be confident they can easily add another to that tally, with the superior attacking qualities of Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy, while snapping their winless run of five matches. Graham Searles"
84,Brighton & Hove Albion,Arsenal,Sat 3 Mar 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Arsène Wenger has been well and truly humbled after back-to-back thrashings at the hands of Manchester City. Arsenal now, if they didn’t quite before, look completely broken and Brighton will be rubbing their hands with glee, not just for warmth, at the very realistic prospect of an important win in terms of their survival. Glenn Murray has four goals in his past five appearances in all competitions and should be able to brush off Arsenal’s atypical defence with ease if given the chance. Graham Searles"
85,Manchester City,Chelsea,Error,2017-18,"A final 10-game title-procession for Manchester City has an apt beginning with the visit of the champions, Chelsea. Defeat Antonio Conte’s side and Pep Guardiola’s will require a maximum 12 more points to be crowned champions for a fifth time. Given City have dropped nine points all season and lost only once in the league under Guardiola, the odds are against Chelsea. Jamie Jackson"
86,Crystal Palace,Manchester United,Sat 3 Mar 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,Crystal Palace have not beaten Manchester United in the top flight since confirming a third place finish 27 years ago and are expecting to be back in the bottom three at kick-off as Roy Hodgson sifts through his ranks of walking wounded to construct a team. United have lost their past two away games in the league but will attempt to capitalise on the encouraging home win against Chelsea. Paul Pogba scored here last season. Maybe the venue will spark an upturn in his fortunes.. Dominic Fifield
87,Southampton,Stoke City,Fri 2 Mar 2018 17.10 GMT,2017-18,"This fixture does not normally have much riding on it come March but this season Southampton and Stoke are sliding into relegation trouble. Paul Lambert has tightened up a porous defence and Saints have a bad habit of letting victories slip away – they have won five and drawn a league-high 12 games this season. Steven Davis and Shane Long face late fitness tests for Southampton, while Ryan Shawcross and Peter Crouch are available for Stoke. Niall McVeigh"
88,Tottenham Hotspur,Huddersfield Town,Fri 2 Mar 2018 17.00 GMT,2017-18,"Huddersfield will never forget their previous visit to Wembley for last season’s Championship play-off – in which they beat Reading on penalties – and wins over Bournemouth and West Brom have boosted their hopes of staying up. This trip feels like a free hit; nothing to lose and everything to gain, although it will be tough. Huddersfield have struggled for away goals and David Wagner says Tottenham are one of the best teams in the world at present. David Hytner"
89,Liverpool,Newcastle United,Fri 2 Mar 2018 14.46 GMT,2017-18,"Rafael Benítez has never lost in five meetings against Liverpool as the manager of Valencia, Chelsea and Newcastle but it will require something special to preserve that record. Liverpool have scored more goals and won more home games against Newcastle than any other team in the Premier League era – 89 and 17 respectively – and, in Roberto Firmino and Mohamed Salah, have two forwards in outstanding form. Salah is bidding to score in a seventh successive game, a feat last achieved at Liverpool by Daniel Sturridge in 2014, while Firmino has 15 in his last 18 starts. Andy Hunter"
90,Watford,West Brom,Fri 2 Mar 2018 14.32 GMT,2017-18,West Bromwich Albion are frozen at the bottom of the table after a run of four successive league defeats and victory at Watford is imperative to avoid their plight deepening further. Gerard Deulofeu’s broken foot provides some hope as the Spaniard had hit the ground running and provided relief from Javi Gracia’s long injury list. However Gracia should not be too concerned as West Brom are terrible away from home – winning once in 14 attempts this season. Graham Searles
91,Swansea City,West Ham United,Fri 2 Mar 2018 13.57 GMT,2017-18,A game that feels like must-win for Swansea and must-not-lose for West Ham. Carlos Carvalhal’s side will move out of the relegation zone and level on points with David Moyes’s team if they can rack up a seventh successive home victory in all competitions. Andre Ayew looks set to make his first start for Swansea since re-signing from West Ham in January and what chance the Ghanaian marks the occasion with a goal? Javier Hernández could return to the West Ham starting lineup after coming off the bench against Liverpool. Stuart James
92,Leicester City,Bournemouth,Fri 2 Mar 2018 13.23 GMT,2017-18,"It is a measure of how tight things are in the mid-to-lower reaches of the Premier League that Bournemouth, who are still not clear of relegation trouble, will move to within a point of eighth-placed Leicester if they win at the King Power Stadium. Leicester have had a little wobble of late, picking up only two points from a possible 12, but Claude Puel’s side should be boosted by the return of Shinji Okazaki, who is available again after being sidelined with a knee injury. Stuart James"
93,Burnley,Everton,Fri 2 Mar 2018 13.06 GMT,2017-18,"Burnley were the victors at Goodison in October toward the end of Ronald Koeman’s reign, and Sean Dyche’s side remain above Everton in the table despite not winning so far this year. With only one set of three points away from home all season, at Newcastle, Everton under Sam Allardyce are not in great shape either and both sides might settle for a draw. Paul Wilson"
94,Manchester United,Chelsea,Sat 24 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,José Mourinho has guided Manchester United to only one win against a direct rival this season – the 3-1 victory at Arsenal in early December. On Sunday this has to change against a Chelsea team only three points behind his side. United fans will hope their manager instructs his men to take the contest to Antonio Conte’s but whether this occurs remains to be seen as Mourinho’s default position can often be safety-first. Jamie Jackson
95,Arsenal,Manchester City,Sat 24 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Manchester City are the favourites and yet, despite the jolts and the latest crash against Östersund on Thursday, there is a part of every Arsenal fan that will watch in hope. Arsène Wenger’s side have bucked the odds in recent Wembley cup showpieces and whatever Wigan can do to City, so can they, right? The likelihood remains that Pep Guardiola will celebrate a first trophy in England, before pushing for two bigger ones. Wenger is chasing the ‘José treble.’ David Hytner"
96,Crystal Palace,Tottenham Hotspur,Sat 24 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Crystal Palace could find themselves back in the bottom three at kick-off on Sunday with the side’s resources now severely hampered by injuries to 12 senior players, so the last thing Roy Hodgson needed was a visit from Tottenham Hotspur. Mauricio Pochettino will sense this as an opportunity to take advantage of Manchester United and Chelsea’s match above them, and Arsenal’s distraction in the League Cup final. His team have won their past five meetings with Palace. The hosts will have to perform out of their skins if that record is to end. Dominic Fifield"
97,Watford,Everton,Fri 23 Feb 2018 17.30 GMT,2017-18,"Everton can move up into seventh, the position they finished last season, with victory over Watford but that may prove difficult as Sam Allardyce’s side have won just once on the road this season. Javi Gracia will be keen to capitalise on their poor away form and record his second win as manager. If Abdoulaye Doucouré can dominate midfield, as he always does when Watford have been at their best, then three important points are achievable. Graham Searles"
98,Liverpool,West Ham United,Fri 23 Feb 2018 17.09 GMT,2017-18,"David Moyes has never won in 14 visits to Anfield as manager, losing seven and drawing seven, and his prospects of guiding West Ham to back-to-back league victories for the first time since December 2016 appear slim given the sensational form of Liverpool’s forwards, fresh from a warm-weather training trip to Marbella. Mohamed Salah has scored 17 goals in his last 16 league appearances and in each of Liverpool’s past five games. Daniel Sturridge was the last Liverpool forward to score in six successive outings back in February 2014. Roberto Firmino is enjoying his most prolific season in English football and Sadio Mané’s last outing brought a hat-trick against Porto. Reasons to be fearful for West Ham. Andy Hunter"
99,Bournemouth,Newcastle United,Fri 23 Feb 2018 16.06 GMT,2017-18,"Bournemouth welcome Rafael Benítez’s Newcastle United to the south coast on the back of a warm-weather training camp in Portugal. Both teams ought to be revitalised after a two-week break and need to hit the ground running on their return to action, with the visitors, in particular, still looking over the shoulder. Jermain Defoe could make his comeback from an ankle injury, most likely from the bench, for the hosts. ”He’s trained and I’m pleased with what we’ve seen, he’s a natural goalscorer,” Eddie Howe said. Ben Fisher"
100,Brighton & Hove Albion,Swansea City,Fri 23 Feb 2018 15.26 GMT,2017-18,Brighton and Swansea are both enjoying a spell of good form and are unbeaten in five and 10 matches respectively in all competitions. Chris Hughton will hope Jürgen Locadia can pick up from where he left off against Coventry and provide the attacking threat his side have lacked at times this season. A win could bump Brighton further from the relegation but the same goes for Swansea. Carlos Carvalhal has completely transformed his side and it would not be surprising if the honeymoon continued at the Amex Stadium. Graham Searles
101,Burnley,Southampton,Fri 23 Feb 2018 12.35 GMT,2017-18,"Burnley were the undoubted success story of the first half of the season, accumulating 32 points from their first 19 games. Since Christmas a brake has been applied, with four draws and four defeats. While survival is unlikely to be an issue for Sean Dyche’s side it is already a worry for Southampton, who come to Turf Moor in the bottom three and in desperate need of points. Paul Wilson"
102,Leicester City,Stoke City,Fri 23 Feb 2018 12.17 GMT,2017-18,"Leicester have lost some momentum in the league following a disappointing run that has been overshadowed by Riyad Mahrez’s antics. Mahrez, however, is set to make his first league start for more than a month here. Stoke, who will be without the injured Peter Crouch, are second from bottom and have not won away for four months. Paul Lambert has vowed to go to Leicester to attack and the Stoke manager has also said he is considering handing a Premier League debut to 18-year-old Tyrese Campbell. Stuart James"
103,West Bromwich Albion,Huddersfield Town,Fri 23 Feb 2018 11.44 GMT,2017-18,Alan Pardew has put his faith in Jonny Evans to lead West Bromwich Albion out of trouble saying “God teaches us to forgive” with regard to reinstating the defender as captain. Pardew seems to recognise the importance of moving quickly on from the Barça business and the best way to do that is with a desperately needed win against Huddersfield. However the signs are not promising for Albion. Pardew has won once in 13 league matches as manager at the Hawthorns and David Wagner’s side were excellent in their 4-1 rot-stopping win over Bournemouth. Graham Searles
104,Rochdale,Spurs,Sat 17 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Rochdale are staring relegation full in the face as they sit bottom of League One and are 11 points from safety. There is some hope in having between three and five games in hand on their rivals for the drop and it is a similar glimmer that Keith Hill will cling to against Tottenham. Mauricio Pochettino has apologised for his criticism of the, now relayed, Spotland pitch but his side’s heroics in Turin might not be ideal preparation. Even with a much-changed lineup, including a debut for Lucas Moura, Tottenham should prevail. Graham Searles"
105,Wigan,Man City,Sat 17 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Wigan have a tremendous FA Cup record against Manchester City in recent years, though since the last upset – the sixth round in 2014, not the 2013 final – the Latics have dropped another division while Pep Guardiola’s side have gone from strength to strength. It is hard to see a surprise result against the runaway Premier League leaders here, especially as Wigan’s promotion push has faltered over the past few days with two successive defeats. A booking at home to Blackpool means influential midfielder Sam Morsy is out through suspension. Paul Wilson"
106,Sheff Wed,Swansea,Fri 16 Feb 2018 17.10 GMT,2017-18,"Carlos Carvalhal returns to Sheffield Wednesday, the Championship club which sacked him on Christmas Eve. Now busy masterminding Swansea City’s revival, Carvalhal knows remaining in the Premier League is infinitely more important than the cup. “We’ll try our best but if we don’t get to the next stage it’s OK,” he said. “We’re underdogs, not because we’re worse than Wednesday, but because we’re outside our main priority which is focusing on staying in the Premier League. There’ll be changes, I’ll protect players. We won’t take any risks.” Louise Taylor"
107,West Brom,Southampton,Fri 16 Feb 2018 16.20 GMT,2017-18,West Bromwich Albion will start on the back foot after the club revealed they are investigating four senior players over an incident at their warm-weather training camp in Spain. However Southampton’s victory earlier in February at the Hawthorns could serve as excellent motivation. Revenge would be sweet and Alan Pardew will be focused on earning a quarter-final spot that could spark his side into life for a tilt at Premier League survival. Graham Searles
108,Brighton,Coventry,Fri 16 Feb 2018 14.48 GMT,2017-18,"Chris Hughton has confirmed Jürgen Locadia is set to make his Brighton debut against Coventry and the striker will surely be looking to show off against the lowest-ranked side left in the FA Cup. Wingers Jordan Maguire-Drew and Kyel Reid are missing for Coventry and with their push for promotion taking a significant hit, after three successive league defeats, Brighton could be forgiven for being confident of smooth passage into the quarter-finals. Graham Searles"
109,Huddersfield,Man Utd,Fri 16 Feb 2018 13.40 GMT,2017-18,"There are two Premier League grounds where José Mourinho has never been on the winning side. Newcastle is the more famous, but on his first visit to Huddersfield in October the Terriers ran out 2-1 winners. That is perhaps the high point of the newly promoted side’s season, more recently they have been sliding down the table, though against Bournemouth last week David Wanger showed he is once again prepared to put faith in attack and try to hurt opponents. Huddersfield’s attempts to play on the front foot may be hampered by the absence of ideas man Aaron Mooy, recovering from a gashed knee. Paul Wilson"
110,Newcastle United,Manchester United,Sat 10 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"A thigh strain permitting, Islam Slimani hopes to makes his Newcastle debut. Can the Algeria striker and Leicester loanee help Rafael Benítez put an old foe, José Mourinho, in his place? Might Slimani be capable of scoring the goals needed to ensure Benitez’s team avoid relegation? Will Mourinho win a Premier League game at St James’ Park for the first time? Can Mo Diamé continue to impress in central midfield for the Tynesiders? Is it really a little over two decades since Newcastle and Manchester United were vying for the Premier League title? Louise Taylor"
111,Southampton,Liverpool,Sat 10 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Liverpool head to the south coast with Jürgen Klopp joking that perhaps they should move their scouting department into the area in reference to the number of players they have signed from Saints recently. Virgil van Dijk became the sixth and last of them in January, and the £75m Dutchman is assured of a rough reception from the home crowd for the manner of his departure, while Adam Lallana, sent off in midweek for the under-23s, may find a place on the bench. Southampton won last week, a six-pointer at West Brom, and are likely to be unchanged with Mauricio Pellegrino, a former Liverpool defender himself, conscious of the need to back that up with another three points as five of their next six league games are away from home. Mark Tallentire"
112,Chelsea,West Bromwich Albion,Sat 10 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"The visit of a club four points adrift at the foot would normally cheer the champions, though West Bromwich Albion pose a particular threat to those in charge at Chelsea. They are not the team to confront when the head coach’s job is on the line, as André Villas-Boas and Roberto Di Matteo might attest. Antonio Conte has seen his side beaten by three goal margins in their last two fixtures, with a top four finish under threat. Alan Pardew’s visitors have a more appealing run of games after Monday, but their own comeback must start somewhere. Why not Stamford Bridge? Dominic Fifield"
113,Huddersfield,Bournemouth,Sat 10 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Huddersfield’s victory at Birmingham City in the FA Cup replay in midweek has given rise to hope that the result will stimulate a confidence boost that could yield their first league victory since before Christmas. They must also find more creativity. Having slid down the table they are nearing the time when every match will be described as a must-win. But Bournemouth, who seemed to be in similar straits until winning two on the trot, have shown how quickly moods can improve, thus representing inspiration, as well as a threat, for David Wagner’s men."
114,Swansea City,Burnley,Fri 9 Feb 2018 18.04 GMT,2017-18,"Swansea’s revival under Carlos Carvalhal has been hugely impressive and seen them glean 11 points from six matches but Burnley will pose a different kind of test to their last three home fixtures in the league, which were against Spurs, Liverpool and Arsenal. Sean Dyche’s side have not won in a Premier League game since December but they remain awkward opponents – only the two Manchester clubs have conceded fewer goals this season. Carvalhal could give debuts to André Ayew and Andy King, while Stephen Ward is fit again for Burnley. Stuart James"
115,Manchester City,Leicester City,Fri 9 Feb 2018 16.25 GMT,2017-18,Pep Guardiola stated pleasure at the display in last Saturday’s draw at Burnley yet a born-winner will want Manchester City to return to victorious ways especially as the Champions League resumes next week. How things have changed for Leicester City and Riyad Mahrez since the latter tore City apart in the same fixture two years ago during the Foxes’ title-winning season. The Algerian is available again but unlikely to start after only returning to training on Friday due to his disgruntlement over a failed move to the league leaders. Jamie Jackson
116,Stoke City,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 9 Feb 2018 14.14 GMT,2017-18,Last week’s defeat at Bournemouth burst the bubble of optimism since Paul Lambert’s arrival and also saw Stoke drop back into the bottom three. Brighton are five places above them but only three points ahead and Chris Hughton’s side are one of those Lambert will be hoping to reel in over the final 12 games. Saturday would be a good place to start. Paul Chronnell
117,Tottenham Hotspur,Arsenal,Fri 9 Feb 2018 13.13 GMT,2017-18,Harry Kane vs Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang is at the top of the bill but this is a fascinating clash on so many levels and it has the trappings of a six-pointer in terms of the race for a top-four finish. Tottenham have come to feel at home at Wembley but Arsenal have won on each of their previous nine visits to the national stadium. How Arsène Wenger’s side need to find some stability and personality away from home. David Hytner
118,West Ham United,Watford,Fri 9 Feb 2018 12.41 GMT,2017-18,Watford will be full of confidence after walloping Chelsea on Monday night. Javi Gracia is settling in nicely after replacing Marco Silva and Watford visit a West Ham side who are three points above the bottom three after last weekend’s defeat at Brighton. David Moyes desperately needs his players to show some fight. At least the arrival of Patrice Evra on a free transfer might help in that regard. Jacob Steinberg
119,Everton,Crystal Palace,Fri 9 Feb 2018 12.30 GMT,2017-18,"Apologies are required all round from Everton as they attempt to put breathing space between themselves and Roy Hodgson’s injury-hit team. Sam Allardyce owes one to Hodgson having not contacted his England predecessor personally in the 17 months since being caught mocking his speech. Everton’s players also need to atone for their apology of a performance, and latest in a series of capitulations, at Arsenal last weekend. Palace are missing nine senior players through injury and Goodison Park will be short on forgiveness should Everton fail to capitalise on their good fortune. Andy Hunter"
120,Crystal Palace,Newcastle United,Sat 3 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Neither Rafael Benítez or Roy Hodgson will be satisfied with their business in the transfer window, though the possibility of Islam Slimani playing some part at Selhurst Park may cheer the Spaniard. Hodgson has now lost Bakary Sako to a broken ankle, a sixth long-term absentee, until into next season and may have to turn sooner than he would have liked to his three young new signings. A year ago, Sunderland came to south London and won 4-0. Newcastle will hope to repeat that trick. Dominic Fifield"
121,Liverpool,Tottenham Hotspur,Sat 3 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Tottenham will arrive on a high following defeat of Manchester United plus a comprehensive victory over Liverpool at Wembley in October. Since that 4-1 reverse, however, Jürgen Klopp’s side have lost only once in 16 league games, scoring 43 goals in that period, and arrested a recent dip with victory at Huddersfield. Only two points separate the teams in the race for Champions League qualification and it would be a significant step towards that goal for Liverpool should they repeat the heights of their last home league display against Manchester City. Andy Hunter"
122,Watford,Chelsea,Sat 3 Feb 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Things looked so good for both these clubs last May. Antonio Conte was basking in leading Chelsea to the title in his first season while Watford secured the services of Marco Silva ahead of a host of other suitors. Wind the clock forward nine months, however, and things have unravelled both in west London and Hertfordshire, with Silva gone and replaced last month by Javi Gracia and Conte seemingly talking his way to the exit door at Stamford Bridge. Chelsea do, however, remain in the top four but Spurs are breathing down their necks and Conte’s side could use a return to winning ways on Monday after the disastrous defeat to Bournemouth. Paul Chronnell"
123,Leicester City,Swansea City,Fri 2 Feb 2018 17.23 GMT,2017-18,"A match that threatens to be overshadowed by the absence of Riyad Mahrez, who has not reported for training at Leicester since he missed out on a move to Manchester City and will play no part here. How unsettling that whole episode has been for Leicester, who are unbeaten at home since mid-December, remains to be seen. Swansea are unlikely to be able to call on new-signing Andre Ayew, who is a major doubt, but Carlos Carvalhal’s side will travel with confidence after back-to-back wins over Liverpool and Arsenal. Stuart James"
124,Manchester United,Huddersfield Town,Fri 2 Feb 2018 15.43 GMT,2017-18,"After the mid-week 2-0 humbling from Tottenham, Manchester United face a side they were poor against earlier in the season, Huddersfield Town, losing 2-1 in October’s reverse fixture. That had been United’s worst performance until the defeat at Wembley and as they are only five points better off than Spurs in fifth, the demand is to bounce straight back and claim victory as Champions League qualification is the absolute minimum required. Jamie Jackson"
125,Burnley,Manchester City,Fri 2 Feb 2018 15.27 GMT,2017-18,Burnley are still seventh in the table and best of the rest even if Sean Dyche’s side have now gone eight league matches without a win and will be hard pushed to buck that trend against Manchester City – who beat them 4-1 in the FA Cup last month. The runaway leaders can expect a tough game but should have more than enough attacking invention to prevail despite not signing Riyad Mahrez. Paul Wilson
126,Arsenal,Everton,Fri 2 Feb 2018 14.47 GMT,2017-18,It will certainly be strange to see Theo Walcott in an Everton shirt at the Emirates but plenty has changed for Arsenal after a frenetic January. The hope is the shake-up can re-energise the club. One thing Arsène Wenger wants to maintain is his side’s impressive home form. He is vexed by the wild contrast to their away results. Walcott may fancy vexing him some more after helping Everton to end a wretched run on Wednesday with two goals in the win over Leicester City. David Hytner
127,Brighton & Hove Albion,West Ham United,Fri 2 Feb 2018 14.38 GMT,2017-18,"Brighton have only claimed victory three times at home this season and their position is beginning to look complicated. The visit of West Ham, blighted by injury and off-field problems, looks like a good opportunity to end their six-match winless run. Record signing Jürgen Locadia is not ready for involvement just yet, although he has begun training, but Leonardo Ulloa should get some minutes on returning to his old home. Brighton are approaching the stage where they need a hero, and perhaps the Argentinian will be that man. Nick Ames"
128,Bournemouth,Stoke City,Fri 2 Feb 2018 13.41 GMT,2017-18,"A brilliant victory at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday pushed Bournemouth into the top half of the Premier League but results at home will be crucial for them guaranteeing their top-flight status. Eddie Howe’s side face Stoke City, who could hand new recruit, the Senegalese midfielder Badou Ndiaye, his debut. Bournemouth have lost just once since Christmas but Howe is not one to get carried away. ”You have to put yourself in the now and my job today is to take the focus onto another tough game.” Ben Fisher"
129,West Brom,Southampton,Fri 2 Feb 2018 11.51 GMT,2017-18,"West Brom are bottom of the table and cannot afford to lose to Southampton who also reside in the relegation zone. Alan Pardew simply needs his side to score more goals and the manager will hope Daniel Sturridge’s finishing can instantly fill the void. Mauricio Pellegrino is unlikely to be too worried though as Sturridge has scored twice this season. A fourth consecutive draw, while not ideal, would keep Saints firmly within the large pack of teams that are all in danger. Graham Searles"
130,Southampton,Tottenham Hotspur,Sat 20 Jan 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"There is little reason for optimism among Southampton fans before this fixture. Tottenham are unbeaten in five while Southampton’s winless league run stretches to 10 games – including a 5-2 Boxing Day thrashing by Spurs. The home side’s only win over Spurs since returning to the Premier League came in May 2016, and was also their last league win over a side in the current top six. Mauricio Pellegrino’s focus now is on the bottom six – Southampton play the other five teams presently in that bracket in the next seven games, so anything gained on Sunday will be a bonus. Niall McVeigh"
131,Swansea City,Liverpool,Sat 20 Jan 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Carlos Carvalhal strayed into “David and Goliath” territory when he was talking about this fixture, which provides a measure of what he feels Swansea are up against. Liverpool put five past them on Boxing Day, two days before Carvalhal was appointed, and their 4-3 victory over Manchester City last weekend provided more evidence of their devastating attacking ability. Mohamed Salah has recovered from illness in time to face Swansea and Virgil van Dijk is also available again. Renato Sanches is back in contention for Swansea. Stuart James"
132,Stoke City,Huddersfield Town,Fri 19 Jan 2018 17.16 GMT,2017-18,"Stoke City need the fabled new manager bounce as they fight to remain in the top flight for a 10th successive season. Alex Pritchard made an impact from the bench on his home debut for Huddersfield and will be looking to expose Stoke’s porous defence. The home side have the worst goal difference in the league, while the visitors have fared only marginally better on that front. Both managers will therefore see this as a winnable game. Reuben Pinder"
133,Everton,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 19 Jan 2018 17.04 GMT,2017-18,"Boosted by their January recruits, Everton will see this match as an opportunity to turn a poor run of form around. Theo Walcott will add some much needed pace and will oppose his former team-mate Kieran Gibbs. West Brom picked up three crucial points against fellow strugglers Brighton last time out and must go into this game with the same positive approach. A win could move Alan Pardew’s side to 17th, should Southampton lose to Tottenham at St Mary’s. Reuben Pinder"
134,Burnley,Manchester United,Fri 19 Jan 2018 16.54 GMT,2017-18,"While the Alexis Sánchez saga continues, Manchester United must put that to one side as they travel to Turf Moor hoping to continue their seven game unbeaten run in the league. The reverse fixture on Boxing Day saw Sean Dyche’s side take a two goal lead at Old Trafford, before Jesse Lingard salvaged a point for United with two goals. Lingard’s heroics have become a recurring theme for José Mourinho’s team, but Burnley have not won at home since early December so the England international may not be leaned on quite as heavily. Reuben Pinder"
135,West Ham United,Bournemouth,Fri 19 Jan 2018 16.20 GMT,2017-18,"While both sides remain in a relegation battle, the winner of this game could be in ninth place at the end of the weekend. Such are the fine margins in the Premier League’s crammed lower reaches. West Ham are on an upward trajectory after thrashing Huddersfield Town and will be confident of gaining revenge for Callum Wilson’s controversial equaliser in their 3-3 draw with Bournemouth on Boxing Day. Yet the visitors are only a point behind David Moyes’s side after their battling win over Arsenal. It could be a nervy afternoon. Jacob Steinberg"
136,Manchester City,Newcastle United,Fri 19 Jan 2018 16.01 GMT,2017-18,"Three weeks after a sole Raheem Sterling strike won the reverse fixture Pep Guardiola’s side welcome Newcastle United. As Manchester United are at Burnley for a 3pm start a win would cut the gap to nine points and maybe – just maybe – apply some kind of pressure on Manchester City. Yet given how relentless the leaders are there will, surely, be only one winner. Jamie Jackson"
137,Leicester City,Watford,Fri 19 Jan 2018 15.05 GMT,2017-18,"Claude Puel says it will be “the beginning of the end” if Leicester start thinking of trying to qualify for the Europa League, although their supporters could be forgiven for wondering if that is a possibility, especially if the team can maintain the sort of form they showed against Chelsea last Saturday. Watford, on the face of it, should be obliging opponents for Leicester. Marco Silva’s side have been in freefall, with their only victory in their past 10 Premier League games coming against Leicester on Boxing Day. Stuart James"
138,Arsenal,Crystal Palace,Fri 19 Jan 2018 13.39 GMT,2017-18,Arsène Wenger has described the current January window as the most disturbing and destabilising he has known and the noises around a clutch of transfer and contractual situations remain loud. Arsenal must block them out against Roy Hodgson’s resurgent Crystal Palace. What was most disturbing for Wenger’s team in last Sunday’s defeat at Bournemouth was the sterile possession and lack of creativity. Palace will look to be compact. Arsenal must find the answers. David Hytner
139,Liverpool,Manchester City,Sat 13 Jan 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Jürgen Klopp starts life without Philippe Coutinho with a request that Anfield forgets the departed Brazilian and concentrates on avenging September’s 5-0 defeat at the Etihad Stadium instead. A key date in the season for both clubs, he says. “City used the momentum and we suffered,” the Liverpool manager said. “We should try to draw a different picture.” Klopp’s side have the form to threaten the league leader’s unbeaten start to the season, having not lost themselves in 13 league games, and City have not won at Anfield since May 2003. The Premier League expects a treat. Andy Hunter"
140,Bournemouth,Arsenal,Sat 13 Jan 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"How Arsène Wenger, who will again be peering from the stands, would love a victory after the nightmare in Nottingham. Arsenal are winless in four in all competitions – their longest barren run since a streak of five starting in February 2016 – and that could easily continue. Eddie Howe can count on making chances with ease against Wenger’s notional defence and that could be enough as the burden of Arsenal’s successes may no longer be able to lie squarely on Alexis Sánchez’s shoulders. The dream of an easier life in Manchester may prove too much of a distraction even if he does play. Graham Searles"
141,Manchester United,Stoke City,Sat 13 Jan 2018 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"José Mourinho, fresh from Manchester United’s break in Dubai, was in relaxed form before Stoke City’s visit. Yet by Monday night his team could be a gaping 18 points behind Manchester City should Pep Guardiola’s side defeat Liverpool. If so, the rest of the season could start to feel particularly embarrassing for Mourinho and his club should City continue to stretch their lead. Jamie Jackson"
142,Watford,Southampton,Fri 12 Jan 2018 18.46 GMT,2017-18,"Two points from six games sees Southampton sit bottom of the Premier League form table but Watford are only one point and one place ahead of them. Marco Silva, who spoke to the Saints before taking the Watford job in May, has a little more credit in the bank but another defeat for Mauricio Pellegrino could see him gone by the time the sides meet again in the FA Cup in two weeks’ time. Paul Chronnell"
143,Huddersfield Town,West Ham United,Fri 12 Jan 2018 18.30 GMT,2017-18,"Huddersfield have not won in the league since their impressive 4-1 victory at Watford on 16 December but their manager, David Wagner, has acted quickly to address any danger of a slump in form by freshening up his squad with the signings of Terence Kongolo and Alex Pritchard. Both are expected to make their debuts against a West Ham side who have fitness doubts over several key players. Rich Flower"
144,West Bromwich Albion,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 12 Jan 2018 18.25 GMT,2017-18,West Bromwich Albion finally ended their marathon run without a win in all competitions last time out but that was against League Two’s Exeter. Alan Pardew has an ideal chance to build on that against Brighton and to spark a revival as Chris Hughton’s side have scored just five goals on the road this season. Hughton will likely want to stifle West Brom as a result to maintain his side’s course for safety. Graham Searles
145,Newcastle United,Swansea City,Fri 12 Jan 2018 17.10 GMT,2017-18,Rafael Benítez is still in the dark about his January transfer budget and does not sound tremendously optimistic about the prospect of actually signing any players this month. Throw in mounting uncertainties about Newcastle’s mooted takeover and Benítez looks to have almost as many problems as Swansea’s Carlos Carvalhal before a relegation six-pointer both managers could desperately do with winning. Potentially key sub-plots include Jonjo Shelvey’s performance against the club he left amid talk of dressing room disruption in south Wales. Louise Taylor
146,Chelsea,Leicester City,Fri 12 Jan 2018 16.56 GMT,2017-18,"It looks like N’Golo Kanté will not be getting a third successive Premier League winner’s medal this May, but the Frenchman remains vital to the reigning champions Chelsea and very much missed by their predecessors, Leicester. Claude Puel has revitalised the Foxes and in particular Jamie Vardy, who will look to exploit a Chelsea defence feeling the strain of being in four competitions. Paul Chronnell"
147,Crystal Palace,Burnley,Fri 12 Jan 2018 16.41 GMT,2017-18,"Roy Hodgson must be wondering what he has done to deserve such rotten luck. Despite transforming Crystal Place’s fortunes since his arrival in September, the former England manager is now confronted with a mounting injury list that has left his squad looking extremely threadbare. Jeffrey Schlupp and Andros Townsend are the latest to miss out, while Burnley counterpart Sean Dyche must make do without top scorer Chris Wood as his side return to London having already beaten Chelsea and drawn with Tottenham in this campaign. Ed Aarons"
148,Tottenham Hotspur,Everton,Fri 12 Jan 2018 16.21 GMT,2017-18,"Defensive stability? Yes. Free-flowing, attacking prowess? No. Sam Allardyce has done what he needed to do and what was expected of him since taking charge at Everton but even he says his team have not been good enough in the final third. The manager hopes the £27m signing of Cenk Tosun can help – the striker scored against Tottenham for his previous club, Besiktas, in the Europa League in 2014. Tottenham, by contrast, are in form and scoring goals. David Hytner"
149,Crystal Palace,Manchester City,Sat 30 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"It is hard to predict anything other than Manchester City celebrating a 19th consecutive victory. The runaway leaders have won six of their past seven games at Selhurst Park in all competitions and will confront a depleted Crystal Palace side with Roy Hodgson sure to rest players before Tuesday’s trip to Southampton. Quite why that fixture could not have been moved back a day remains a mystery, but bBe braced for Hodgson’s pragmatism to prompt another round of knee-jerk accusations that the Premier League is becoming increasingly uncompetitive. Dominic Fifield"
150,West Bromwich Albion,Arsenal,Sat 30 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"West Bromwich Albion know how to beat Arsenal. Fire as many balls into the box as often as possible from wide areas, set pieces, goal kicks and throw-ins. Why not even punt it in from kick-off? Arsène Wenger’s lamentable defence has no answer for such tactics at present and concede more than two goals on average in the league when they are breached. Fortunately Wenger still has Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez to bail him out of trouble. Graham Searles"
151,Watford,Swansea City,Fri 29 Dec 2017 18.36 GMT,2017-18,Carlos Carvalhal takes charge of his first game as the Swansea City manager with the huge task of avoiding relegation on his hands. Lightning will need to strike twice for Swansea as they were bottom at this stage of the season last year. Watford arrested their terrible run last time out and Marco Silva will want to build on that 2-1 Boxing Day home win against Leicester City on Saturday. Graham Searles
152,Huddersfield Town,Burnley,Fri 29 Dec 2017 18.10 GMT,2017-18,"Huddersfield seem to have refound some of their early season form and will hope to catch Burnley still reeling from their agonising draw at Old Trafford. However, Sean Dyche has to show that their is only so much romance to go around in the Premier League with a typical ruthlessly efficient win. Three points maintains their Champions League tilt. Admit it, we all want to see Burnley v Barcelona next season. Graham Searles"
153,Liverpool,Leicester City,Fri 29 Dec 2017 17.44 GMT,2017-18,"The world’s most expensive defender, Virgil van Dijk, is expected to observe proceedings from the directors’ box at Anfield before officially completing his £75m transfer from Southampton on Monday. While all eyes strain for a sight of Liverpool’s statement of intent, however, Jürgen Klopp’s focus will be on breaking a barren run against Claude Puel. The Leicester City manager was unbeaten in four meetings with Liverpool while at Southampton last season and will be seeking defensive improvement after four games without a win. Andy Hunter"
154,Manchester United,Southampton,Fri 29 Dec 2017 16.31 GMT,2017-18,"Whatever José Mourinho says about not having enough money – a £261m spend, anyone? – the bottom line is Manchester United are 15 points behind rivals Manchester City after 20 games. It means the title is all but over and so the manager’s job is to ensure United finish second. At the moment they are a point ahead of Chelsea so victory over Southampton is essential. Jamie Jackson"
155,Chelsea,Stoke City,Fri 29 Dec 2017 14.41 GMT,2017-18,"Stoke City, with a solitary away win to their name all season, travel to Stamford Bridge severely depleted defensively in the absence of Kurt Zouma, Ryan Shawcross and Bruno Martins Indi. The Premier League champions are 16 points behind Manchester City and their domestic season is now a sprint towards Champions League qualification. Antonio Conte’s slightly rejigged team are seeking a 10th win in 13 matches and an eighth in succession at home. Momentum must be maintained before next week’s visit to Arsenal. Dominic Fifield"
156,Newcastle United,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 29 Dec 2017 14.26 GMT,2017-18,"Last season’s Championship top two have enjoyed similar fortunes in the Premier League, with both starting well before fading and then steadying themselves with a victory just before Christmas.

A Bournemouth team with severe injury problems have not tasted victory since November while Everton are looking for a first win in three before facing Manchester United and Liverpool next week. Ben Fisher"
158,Southampton,Huddersfield Town,Fri 22 Dec 2017 18.23 GMT,2017-18,"This could prove to be a pivotal game for Mauricio Pellegrino. His team are in 12th place but only three points above the relegation zone, with trips to Wembley and Old Trafford up next. They face a Huddersfield side capable of punishing out-of-form hosts, as they showed last week against Watford. Pellegrino is without both first choice fullbacks, with Cédric Soares and Ryan Bertrand both injured in the midweek defeat to Chelsea, while top scorer Charlie Austin is likely to return up front. Niall McVeigh"

Alan Pardew desperately needs a win of his own as the Baggies sit second from bottom showing promise but little end product. Jonny Evans thinking of potential pastures new could provide Stoke with a vital inroad. Graham Searles

The visitors will be anxious to put the 4-1 defeat at Manchester City on their last trip to the north west behind them, while the home side will be missing ever-present James Tarkowski for the next three matches, the defender having picked up a retrospective ban for elbowing Glenn Murray at Brighton.

Now though it would be a major surprise if Bournemouth were able to escape the Etihad Stadium with a draw. City are so supreme at present that, if Eddie Howe’s side do take all three points they will have produced a shock of giant-killing dimension. Jamie Jackson"
164,Swansea City,Crystal Palace,Fri 22 Dec 2017 15.24 GMT,2017-18,Leon Britton takes charge as caretaker player-manager against Crystal Palace but will be able to help struggling Swansea only from the dugout owing to a calf injury. A repeat of last year’s epic 5-4 win seems unlikely as the home side have scored just 10 goals in 18 matches – half as many as this time last season – and face Roy Hodgson’s rebuilt Palace rather than Alan Pardew’s derelict defence. Graham Searles
165,Everton,Chelsea,Fri 22 Dec 2017 14.37 GMT,2017-18,"The third meeting between the clubs this season sees Antonio Conte facing a third different Everton manager, and a different proposition now that Sam Allardyce is at the helm. Eden Hazard may lead the Chelsea attack with Álvaro Morata suspended after collecting a fifth booking of the campaign in midweek for celebrating his wife’s pregnancy. Everton’s new manager made no apologies for an ultra-defensive display away at Liverpool recently but whether another can be deployed at Goodison Park in a bid to protect his unbeaten start is questionable. Andy Hunter"
166,Brighton & Hove Albion,Watford,Fri 22 Dec 2017 13.44 GMT,2017-18,"Brighton are in need of a win and this could be a perfect opportunity. Watford’s early lustre under Marco Silva has faded; they have lost four of their past five – seven of their past 10, looking further back – and among today’s long list of absentees is the influential Abdoulaye Doucouré. Chris Hughton must make one change himself, with the centre-back Shane Duffy suspended, and the home side will hope to build on last weekend’s good showing against Burnley in their bid to avoid a harsh winter. Nick Ames"
167,Everton,Swansea City,Sat 16 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Five games without defeat have elevated Everton’s position and mood under Sam Allardyce and with Yannick Bolasie available for the first time in 12 months, the new manager’s options are improving too. How Paul Clement could do with a similar turnaround. Swansea remain bottom of the table following a lesson by Manchester City, although they are not the only team to suffer that fate this season, and have not won away in the league since August. Their recent home win over West Bromwich Albion, however, demonstrates there can be no complacency at Goodison Park. Andy Hunter"
168,Bournemouth,Liverpool,Sat 16 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"For Jürgen Klopp, a trip to Bournemouth is a headache his Liverpool side could probably do without. After stuttering to draws at home to Everton and then West Bromwich Albion, they now face Eddie Howe’s side, who on home turf have a habit of giving the bigger sides a fright – if not worse – as in this fixture last season when Bournemouth came from 3-1 behind to take victory. Klopp could again make changes – Simon Mignolet may return in goal – while Howe, too, has said he will rotate owing to the hectic festive schedule. Ben Fisher"
169,West Bromwich Albion,Manchester United,Sat 16 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"West Bromwich Albion’s wait for a win has continued under Alan Pardew and will stand at a heady four months if unsuccessful against Manchester United. The vast amount of draws accrued are keeping their heads narrowly above water, just. United have to win to maintain hopes of another league title but the side’s performance may be affected before kick-off should Manchester City beat Tottenham on Saturday. Graham Searles"
170,Watford,Huddersfield Town,Fri 15 Dec 2017 18.34 GMT,2017-18,Watford are in a tough spot with a large number of injured players combined with Tom Cleverley and Marvin Zeegelaar missing through suspension. David Wagner will definitely be looking to pounce on Marco Silva’s misfortune as Huddersfield could do with a win. But that could prove challenging. Wagner’s side have not scored an away goal since the opening day. Graham Searles
171,Stoke City,West Ham United,Fri 15 Dec 2017 17.14 GMT,2017-18,"The league’s most porous defences meet but, as if by magic, West Ham United’s has dramatically improved of late. They have kept two consecutive clean sheets since Joe Hart vanished from the goalmouth. David Moyes will be delighted those blanks took four points from meetings with Chelsea and Arsenal but should also be wary of his side’s confidence growing too rapidly. Stoke City have no such conjuring to call on and fans will fear their record-worst start to a Premier League season rolls on. Could Tony Pulis be on his way back to the Potteries? Graham Searles"
172,Manchester City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 15 Dec 2017 16.35 GMT,2017-18,"Manchester City have not beaten Tottenham Hotspur since May 2015, which means Pep Guardiola is yet to defeat Mauricio Pochetinno’s side since taking over. The smart money, though, says Saturday will be the day as City are 18 points better off and flying. If Spurs can worry the home side through pace, though, as Liverpool did in September before Sadio Mané’s sending off, they may have a chance of handing City a first league defeat. Jamie Jackson"
173,Brighton & Hove Albion,Burnley,Fri 15 Dec 2017 16.16 GMT,2017-18,Brighton are experiencing their first rocky patch since coming up and after such a good start have begun to look rather like a promoted side – conceding sloppy goals and failing to put chances away. The latter is a particular concern; their only goal in the past five games has come from the penalty spot and Burnley will take some imagination to break down. Sean Dyche and company have set a standard for teams in Albion’s position: at worst Saturday may be a useful learning exercise. Nick Ames
174,Arsenal,Newcastle United,Fri 15 Dec 2017 15.49 GMT,2017-18,"Rafael Benítez has tried everything in recent games – different formations, different personnel – and the captain, Jamaal Lascelles, admitted there had been harsh words after Wednesday’s loss to Everton. But Newcastle United have been unable to stop their slump; it is now seven defeats in eight and, unsurprisingly, the nerve ends on Tyneside are raw. A visit to Arsenal does not seem like the best medicine but Arsène Wenger’s side are also jittery. David Hytner"
175,Chelsea,Southampton,Fri 15 Dec 2017 15.36 GMT,2017-18,"Antonio Conte expects to “suffer” against Southampton, which was a surprising choice of words before the visit of a team thrashed at home in midweek by Leicester. Yet Chelsea expect their visitors to be stung by that loss, and therefore much improved from the lethargic mishmash which succumbed too easily on the south coast. “The coach, the club, the players don’t want to extend a bad run, and will want to give a response against a team like Chelsea,” said Conte. “Manchester City only beat them recently in the 96th minute.” The champions will be wary. Dominic Fifield"
176,Leicester City,Crystal Palace,Fri 15 Dec 2017 13.18 GMT,2017-18,"Leicester City and Crystal Palace are on fine runs of form and the latter would get out of the bottom three, for a day at least, with a draw. A problem Roy Hodgson has to solve though is Palace’s goal tally of zero from eight away games. Leicester, meanwhile, have only failed to score once at home this season against Manchester City. Hodgson should be very wary of baiting Claude Puel’s revitalised Foxes. Graham Searles"
177,Southampton,Arsenal,Sat 9 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Recent games between these two sides on the south coast have produced some emphatic scorelines – Southampton won 4-0 on Boxing Day two years ago to throw Arsenal’s title challenge into disarray, but in two trips to St Mary’s in 2017, Arsenal have scored seven and conceded none. Mauricio Pellegrino is expected to stick with in-form striker Charlie Austin despite Shane Long recovering from a calf problem as he looks to improve that record. Arsène Wenger will be without defender Shkodran Mustafi but Theo Walcott, who scored a hat-trick against his former club in January’s FA Cup win, should be available despite a tight calf. Niall McVeigh"
178,Manchester United,Manchester City,Sat 9 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"The showdown of the season so far. Despite each manager’s public platitudes José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola know a victory for their side will have a seismic effect on the title race. If the Portuguese’s Manchester United can cut the gap to five points it gives them belief and boosts Chelsea, who are a further three points back. Lose and the Catalan’s Manchester City would return to their base in the east of the city cock a-hoop due to a near four-wins advantage. Jamie Jackson"
179,Liverpool,Everton,Sat 9 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"A sense of calm may have descended on Everton after three consecutive wins and clean sheets but Anfield brings one of trepidation and not only on account of their appalling record across Stanley Park. Jürgen Klopp is the only Liverpool manager in history to win his first three derbies, his team have plundered 12 goals in two games and look perfectly equipped to prey on Everton’s many weaknesses. Sam Allardyce has a decent derby record overall but it will require a stunning transformation – from both sides – to trouble Liverpool’s unbeaten home run against their rivals, one that stands at 17 league games. Andy Hunter"
180,Newcastle Utd,Leicester City,Fri 8 Dec 2017 17.21 GMT,2017-18,"Newcastle United hope to celebrate the 125th anniversary of their formation by arresting a dismal run which has seen them collect one point from six games. If the return of Christian Atsu - a winger possessing the pace collectively lacking in the side - and captain Jamaal Lascelles is welcome, Rafael Benitez’s players will need to be mindful of Leicester’s dangerous counter-attacking. With Sam Allardyce’s Everton in Toon on Wednesday and Mike Ashley having discussed a club sale over a Hampstead curry with Amanda Staveley this is a potentially pivotal week on Tyneside. Louise Taylor"
181,Swansea City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 8 Dec 2017 16.49 GMT,2017-18,Having gone bottom of the table Paul Clement will be desperate for a result against a West Brom side that have already pulled the trigger on their under-fire manager Tony Pulis. Alan Pardew has since stepped into the breach but on his last visit to Swansea a late collapse condemned his old Crystal Palace side to an astonishing 5-4 defeat – he’ll be hoping for better luck with his new club. Étienne Fermie
182,Crystal Palace,Bournemouth,Fri 8 Dec 2017 16.00 GMT,2017-18,"Roy Hodgson’s Crystal Palace are much improved and off the foot of the table – no mean feat since they are without an away league goal since April – but their precarious predicament means they cannot afford to pass up the chance to build on recent momentum against an inconsistent Bournemouth. The visitors have not lost at Selhurst Park since 1988 but, with Adam Smith suspended, will be wary of the threat posed by Wilfried Zaha with Palace having scored twice in each of their last four home games. Dominic Fifield"
183,Tottenham Hotspur,Stoke City,Fri 8 Dec 2017 15.46 GMT,2017-18,"Spurs are looking to end a run of four without a win in the Premier League as they welcome Stoke City to Wembley. Last week the Potters ended their own four-match sequence without a victory – but having lost their last three against Tottenham 4-0, could face the ignominy of becoming the first side in Premier League history to lose by four goals or more to a side four times in a row. Étienne Fermie"
184,West Ham United,Chelsea,Fri 8 Dec 2017 15.37 GMT,2017-18,"Although West Ham remain winless under David Moyes, who is set to keep Adrián in goal in place of Joe Hart, there were signs of improvement during last Sunday’s 2-1 defeat at Manchester City. West Ham still have plenty of injury concerns and Chelsea come into this match in excellent form. Eden Hazard could increase the suffering for Moyes’s strugglers. Jacob Steinberg"
185,Burnley,Watford,Fri 8 Dec 2017 14.47 GMT,2017-18,"The Premier League’s surprise duo meet at Turf Moor and eighth-placed Watford could draw level with their high-flying hosts with a victory. Both clubs have managed to hang on to their in-demand managers, Sean Dyche and Marco Silva, but the former has not been helped by the serious knee injury to Robbie Brady at Leicester last Saturday which could rule him out for the season. Paul Chronnell"
186,Huddersfield Town,Brighton,Fri 8 Dec 2017 14.29 GMT,2017-18,"Two of the clubs promoted from the Championship last May can compare notes on how they are finding the Premier League – not too bad judging by their presence above the relegation zone. Huddersfield won this fixture 3-1 in February but on that occasion Izzy Brown was playing for the Terriers, on loan from Chelsea. Now on the south coast, Brown will line up for Brighton today. Paul Chronnell"
187,Manchester City,West Ham United,Sat 2 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"If Pep Guardiola could choose a team against whom to try to gain a 20th win on the trot he might well pick West Ham. David Moyes’s side suffered a 4-0 humiliation at fellow-strugglers Everton in mid-week, which included Wayne Rooney’s wonder goal, and will surely not fancy facing Manchester City away. If Manchester United win at Arsenal on Saturday it may put some pressure on Guardiola’s side but, really, they should still defeat West Ham whatever may have happened. Jamie Jackson"
188,Bournemouth,Southampton,Sat 2 Dec 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Goals have been fairly scarce for both these sides so far, although Southampton did help themselves to four against Everton last weekend. Eddie Howe will be hoping Josh King – who currently has more goals for Norway (three) than Premier League goals (two) this season – finds form as he did in 2016-17 when 14 of his 16 Bournemouth strikes came after the start of December. Rich Flower"
189,Watford,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 1 Dec 2017 18.49 GMT,2017-18,"In remarkably similar pre-match analyses Marco Silva stressed Watford, who have lost four of their last six, need to “be smart”, “more mature” and “make the right decisions”, while Mauricio Pochettino said Spurs, who have lost their last three away, must “be calm” and not “take decisions with emotion”. Only a win by six or more can stop Watford ending the day in eighth. Simon Burnton"
190,West Bromwich Albion,Crystal Palace,Fri 1 Dec 2017 18.39 GMT,2017-18,"Alan Pardew’s first game in charge of West Brom, perhaps inevitably, is against the last team he managed. Crystal Palace showed Pardew the door three days before Christmas last year as they struggled near the bottom of the league but the Baggies’ board clearly believe he has not lost all his powers of motivation and resuscitation as the festive programme approaches. Conrad Leach"
191,Stoke City,Swansea City,Fri 1 Dec 2017 18.31 GMT,2017-18,Mark Hughes has admitted this is a must-win match for Stoke City who badly need to reverse the downward spiral in which they seem locked. The same can be said of Paul Clement’s Swansea City who have failed to win in their past six attempts and for whom Wilfried Bony could not make a more timely return to form. Is December too early to talk about relegation six-pointers? Paul Doyle
192,Leicester City,Burnley,Fri 1 Dec 2017 18.03 GMT,2017-18,"The closest-looking game of the weekend with all three results eminently feasible, resurgent Leicester will expect to win it all the same after snuffing out the title ambitions of Spurs in midweek. Three places above them in sixth place, Burnley have had tougher away games already and apart from the loss at Manchester City have returned from the others with at least a point. Mark Tallentire"
193,Everton,Huddersfield Town,Fri 1 Dec 2017 17.54 GMT,2017-18,"Sam Allardyce is still counting his lucky stars that he gets to take over a team with more points, 15, than games played, 14, and after watching the midweek win which made it so, is happy to have Oumar Niasse, Michael Keane and a full bench available to help offset fatigue. David Wagner says facing a new manager isn’t a ‘major problem’ as everybody is aware how he usually sets up. Mark Tallentire"
194,Chelsea,Newcastle United,Fri 1 Dec 2017 17.29 GMT,2017-18,"Chelsea have dropped only two points since that slapdash defeat at Selhurst Park in October and can unleash Eden Hazard back into the fray after the Belgian featured for only nine minutes in the midweek win over Swansea. Newcastle, in contrast, have won only once since September and boast a solitary victory at Stamford Bridge since 1986. Their comeback at the Hawthorns on Tuesday offers some cause for optimism but Rafael Benítez, a Europa League winner as Chelsea’s interim manager, is braced for an awkward return. Dominic Fifield"
195,Arsenal,Manchester United,Fri 1 Dec 2017 17.09 GMT,2017-18,Arsène Wenger will be disappointed to be without the services of Alexandre Lacazette but with Mesut Özil’s magical range of passing the manager can at least be confident the striker’s replacement should have chances. José Mourinho will want more from Romelu Lukaku but the Belgian’s struggles may continue. Wenger’s side have been growing stronger defensively and in doing so have kept three successive clean sheets. Graham Searles
196,Brighton & Hove Albion,Liverpool,Fri 1 Dec 2017 15.18 GMT,2017-18,"Events off the field overshadowed Brighton’s stalemate with Crystal Palace on Tuesday, their fourth consecutive draw at home. Only Manchester City have left the Amex Stadium with three points this season. Jürgen Klopp made six changes for the win at Stoke on Wednesday and is likely to shuffle his pack again. After starting the past two games Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain is finding his feet at Anfield. Tim Knowles"
197,Huddersfield,Manchester City,Sat 25 Nov 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Christopher Schindler is Huddersfield’s best defender and the German makes a timely return from suspension, but it will still take something special for Huddersfield to neutralise the fearsome attacking power of Manchester City. David Wagner’s side have already toppled Manchester United at home this season but a repeat performance is a tall order against a City team who have won all of their away matches this season. Paul Doyle"
198,Southampton,Everton,Sat 25 Nov 2017 08.59 GMT,2017-18,"Something’s got to give at St Mary’s as sShot-shy Southampton take on porous Everton. The visitors’ interim manager, David Unsworth, challenged his reshuffled Europa League team to give him a selection dilemma but Wayne Rooney, Sandro and Davy Klaassen weakened their case in the 5-1 defeat. Mauricio Pellegrino is under growing pressure with three league wins all season and may fast-track Mario Lemina back into his team with Oriel Romeu suspended. These sides were the “best of the rest” last season; that seems like a long time ago. Niall McVeigh"
199,Burnley,Arsenal,Sat 25 Nov 2017 08.59 GMT,2017-18,"Arsenal have not lost in their six Premier League meetings with Burnley to date, though Sean Dyche can only be encouraged by going into this meeting level on points with Arsène Wenger’s side (and Liverpool) in late November. Fresh from victory in the north London derby, Arsenal will be hoping for more of the same at Turf Moor, yet Burnley could be fresher still by virtue of not having played in the Europa League. Paul Wilson"
200,Newcastle United,Watford,Fri 24 Nov 2017 17.47 GMT,2017-18,"Takeover talk has reached fever pitch on Tyneside but, before Newcastle can be transformed by hundreds of Middle Eastern millions, Mike Ashley must accept an offer from Amanda Staveley. Until that happens there is a sense of limbo; not that Rafa Benítez can allow Newcastle, who have lost their past three games, to tread water. An intriguing tactical duel between Benítez and Watford’s Marco Silva – (much admired by managerless Everton) – will be spiced by the return of Newcastle’s Mikel Merino from injury. Louise Taylor"
201,Tottenham Hotspur,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 24 Nov 2017 15.44 GMT,2017-18,"Gary Megson has had a busy week as West Brom’s caretaker. He reshuffled the backroom staff and told the assistant, Ben Garner, to stay away, and is now trying to get a tune out of a team with four draws and six defeats from the last 10. Spurs at Wembley would not have been his game of choice either, even if he last featured there as a player with Sheffield Wednesday in 1988. Mark Tallentire"
202,Liverpool,Chelsea,Fri 24 Nov 2017 15.37 GMT,2017-18,"Antonio Conte conducted preparations for Anfield on the flight home from Qarabag as Chelsea managed only one full training session before travelling to Liverpool. For the home side, post-Champions League fatigue may be more in mind than body after blowing a three-goal lead against Sevilla on Tuesday. A home win will take Jürgen Klopp’s side level on points with the champions but, Crystal Palace apart, Chelsea have impressed on the road this season – collecting 15 points from a possible 18 on their travels compared to 10 at Stamford Bridge. Mohamed Salah’s form will worry his old club. Andy Hunter"
203,Swansea City,Bournemouth,Fri 24 Nov 2017 14.43 GMT,2017-18,"The pressure is building on Paul Clement and, although the Swansea manager is confident his job is not on the line, another defeat would be a huge blow, especially with a trip to Chelsea to come on Wednesday. Tammy Abraham will have to miss that game because of his loan agreement and is also a major doubt against Bournemouth because of a back problem. Eddie Howe’s side, with three wins from their past four league games, appear resurgent and will fancy their chances. Stuart James"
204,Manchester United,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 24 Nov 2017 14.11 GMT,2017-18,"José Mourinho has highlighted the fact Manchester United’s three league matches in the coming eight days are crucial to his side’s title challenge. First up are Brighton, whose position in ninth suggests they are no pushovers. Winning is imperative for United, given the eight-point deficit to the leaders Manchester City. Jamie Jackson"
205,Crystal Palace,Stoke City,Fri 24 Nov 2017 13.09 GMT,2017-18,"It may not yet be December, but it feels as if crunch time is already upon Crystal Palace. Roy Hodgson has overseen significantly improved performances over his side’s past five matches, yet the team have still won only once all term and are adrift at the foot playing catch-up from that wretched start. Stoke City, who have not won at Selhurst Park in a decade and are enduring their own inconsistencies, must surely be overcome if Palace’s confidence is to be bolstered before Tuesday’s derby at Brighton. This may be the time to fling Christian Benteke back into the fray from the start. Dominic Fifield"
206,Watford,West Ham United,Sat 18 Nov 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"David Moyes takes charge of his 500th Premier League game and his first as West Ham United manager. Unfortunately he will be without the club’s top scorer, Javier Hernández, who was injured playing for Mexico. Despite Moyes’s emphasis on improved work ethic, Marco Silva will probably look to apply as much pressure on West Ham’s porous defence as possible to stop a run of three defeats. Graham Searles"
207,Brighton & Hove Albion,Stoke City,Sat 18 Nov 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Brighton put together a run of two wins and two draws, built on Glenn Murray’s four goals in three games, before the international break and are eighth in the table as a result. Lee Grant starts in place of the injured Jack Butland for Stoke and Murray will be relishing facing the replacement, especially as Stoke have conceded an average of two goals a game this season and just one fewer in total than the league’s worst tally. Graham Searles"
208,Leicester City,Manchester City,Fri 17 Nov 2017 18.41 GMT,2017-18,"What chance a repeat of last season? Leicester beat Manchester City 4-2 on that occasion, with Jamie Vardy scoring a hat-trick as Pep Guardiola’s side somewhat naively played into the hands of the then Premier League champions. Now City are an entirely different proposition and it is hard to see how anyone can stop a team that is unbeaten in 23 matches and scoring goals at a ridiculous rate. City will, however, have to make do without the suspended key defender Nicolás Otamendi at the King Power Stadium. Stuart James"
209,Manchester United,Newcastle United,Fri 17 Nov 2017 18.20 GMT,2017-18,"After 11 matches Manchester United trail the leaders, Manchester City, by eight points and are already playing catch-up. Their last outing was the defeat at Chelsea and, given how shrewd Rafael Benítez is, Newcastle United may provide a real test at Old Trafford. But Paul Pogba, Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo are all back in the match-day squad to give United a considerable boost and if they are to genuinely challenge for the title, José Mourinho’s side really have to win. Jamie Jackson"
210,Burnley,Swansea City,Fri 17 Nov 2017 18.02 GMT,2017-18,"Only Manchester City have managed to beat Burnley in their past nine league games, a run of results that has taken the Clarets to within goal difference of the top six. That sort of form has brought Sean Dyche to the nation’s attention and ought to be enough to see off struggling Swansea, though the Welsh side have to be looking to take points from Burnley and should have Renato Sanches and Wilfried Bony back after injury. Paul Wilson"
211,West Bromwich Albion,Chelsea,Fri 17 Nov 2017 17.12 GMT,2017-18,"Tony Pulis will have welcomed the international break to give him time to mastermind an upturn in form but, with the champions in town, one wonders whether the Welshman needed longer to prepare. Antonio Conte has fond memories of the Hawthorns after Chelsea secured the title there last season and the Italian will be demanding another win to stay in touch with Manchester City. Graham Searles"
212,Crystal Palace,Everton,Fri 17 Nov 2017 15.28 GMT,2017-18,"These sides’ miserable starts cost them managers. Everton still wait to make a permanent appointment but they are in better shape now than a few weeks ago and ended an eight-match winless run just before the international break. They have also reintegrated Morgan Schneiderlin and Kevin Mirallas to the squad. Crystal Palace’s points tally for the season has been gleaned from their last two home fixtures, while Christian Benteke is fit again. Both teams will consider this an opportunity to maintain their recovery. Dominic Fifield"
213,Liverpool,Southampton,Fri 17 Nov 2017 15.10 GMT,2017-18,"Jürgen Klopp has not beaten Southampton in four league meetings but, after three straight wins in all competitions and with his squad nearing full fitness, he said: “Now is a good moment to strike back.” Adam Lallana, who is yet to make an appearance this season, is unlikely to feature against his old club but Sadio Mané could play after a hamstring scare. Mauricio Pellegrino, who played 13 times for Liverpool in 2005, has maintained Southampton’s defensive discipline, since replacing Claude Puel, but scoring has been a struggle. His team have conceded and scored only three goals away from home this term. Andy Hunter"
214,Bournemouth,Huddersfield Town,Fri 17 Nov 2017 13.23 GMT,2017-18,"Eddie Howe knows the importance of getting a result at home to Huddersfield Town. “Our run now will define our season and we have got off to a good start,” the Bournemouth manager said. After a last-gasp win at St James’ Park, his side are targeting successive league wins for the first time since April. David Wagner’s side, meanwhile, have not won on the road since the opening day of the season, a 3-0 victory over Crystal Palace at Selhurst Park. Ben Fisher"
215,Arsenal,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 17 Nov 2017 13.04 GMT,2017-18,"Tottenham will make the short trip to the Emirates more confident than ever of showing they are the dominant force in north London. Spurs have the x-factor in Harry Kane who has never failed to score against Arsenal in the league. Arsène Wenger, who boasts 10 consecutive league wins at home, needs to come up with a plan to stop the striker, who is rested after missing England duty. Graham Searles"
216,Everton,Watford,Sat 4 Nov 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"Everton are in free-fall before what could be David Unsworth’s final game as caretaker manager. Ten defeats in 14 matches embarrass an expensive squad and those who assembled it, and fear will deepen around Goodison Park should Marco Silva’s Watford inflict an 11th. Unsworth has suffered three defeats in three difficult away fixtures with a hectic schedule disrupting his search for a settled side. Goodison will be firmly behind the club’s popular former defender but the unknown is whether Everton’s highly-paid, experienced players will finally take responsibility for the slide. Andy Hunter"
217,Chelsea,Manchester United,Sat 4 Nov 2017 09.00 GMT,2017-18,"It will be fascinating to see whether José Mourinho arrives back at Stamford Bridge with caution on his mind given Chelsea’s defeat in Rome in midweek suggested the champions are there for the taking. Antonio Conte, stung personally by that embarrassment, has conducted his own debrief and will expect a response from his side, but so much hinges on how N’Golo Kanté trains on Saturday and whether he declares himself fit to feature. The return of Nemanja Matic and, to a lesser extent, Juan Mata add another layer of intrigue to a potentially combustible occasion. Dominic Fifield"

City, though, are flying with the manager particularly content with the goal tally – 49 in all competitions – and the mental strength of his players. Arsenal are nine points behind and if they wish to be in the title race they need to win at the Etihad Stadium. Jamie Jackson"
219,Tottenham Hotspur,Crystal Palace,Sat 4 Nov 2017 08.59 GMT,2017-18,"It doesn’t get any easier for Roy Hodgson and Crystal Palace. His schedule since taking over from Frank de Boer has seen meetings with the Manchester clubs and Chelsea, and now he runs into a Tottenham team flying after their midweek Champions League triumph against Real Madrid. Hodgson will take inspiration from the way that Palace upset the odds to beat Chelsea while Tottenham will be wary of Wilfried Zaha, a player they would love to sign. David Hytner"
220,Swansea City,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 3 Nov 2017 18.31 GMT,2017-18,"This feels like a must-win game for Swansea who are outside the relegation zone only on goal difference and have lost four of their five home league games this season. They will be missing Renato Sanches, Martin Olsson and Leon Britton but Wilfried Bony has a chance of making the bench. Brighton, who look more comfortable in the Premier League after a run that has gleaned eight points from their past five matches, promise to be awkward opponents. Stuart James"
221,Stoke City,Leicester City,Fri 3 Nov 2017 18.16 GMT,2017-18,Claude Puel’s tenure as Southampton manager ended with a home defeat by Stoke City and now he will attempt to avenge that and extend his positive start with Leicester City. It will be interesting to see whether he changes the lineup that defeated Everton last Sunday. Stoke also go into the game in high spirits and hope to achieve back-to-back league wins for the first time this season. Paul Doyle
222,Huddersfield Town,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 3 Nov 2017 17.54 GMT,2017-18,"Huddersfield Town could be forgiven for expecting to win on current form especially after beating Manchester United in their last match at home. However West Bromwich Albion showed they still have a huge amount of spirit, in their narrow loss to Manchester City, and will be keen to show David Wagner exactly how difficult it can be to face a Tony Pulis side. If West Brom can find some attacking fluency they could finally end their nine-match winless run as Huddersfield have scored just three in their past nine, failing to score in seven. Graham Searles"
223,Newcastle United,Bournemouth,Fri 3 Nov 2017 16.16 GMT,2017-18,"As Amanda Staveley’s proposed takeover inches closer, Newcastle fans dream of Champions League nights. Meanwhile their team could do with beating Bournemouth. With games against Huddersfield, Swansea and Burnley on the horizon, Simon Francis, Eddie Howe’s captain, has described November as “a make or break month”. The bad news for Howe is that Premier League Saturday matches at home suit Rafael Benítez, he has won his last 31 such fixtures, the most recent five during his Newcastle tenure. Louise Taylor"
224,Southampton,Burnley,Fri 3 Nov 2017 16.00 GMT,2017-18,"Burnley have lost just once on their travels this season and will go level on points with Chelsea and Arsenal if they win at St Mary’s. That might be easier said than done, with speculation growing that Sean Dyche is set to depart for Everton. Chris Wood faces a late fitness test on his hamstring, while Steven Defour should be available. For the hosts, Charlie Austin has recovered from a knock but Mario Lemina is out until after the international break. Mauricio Pellegrino’s side have lacked consistency, but could stretch their unbeaten run to four games if the visitors prove to be distracted. Niall McVeigh"
225,West Ham United,Liverpool,Fri 3 Nov 2017 15.07 GMT,2017-18,"A fortnight on from that thumping by Tottenham, Liverpool have a spring in their step again after successive 3-0 home wins over Huddersfield and Maribor. They won 4-0 at the London Stadium last season and will back themselves to overcome the absence of Philippe Coutinho against a West Ham side who have been hit by an injury crisis in defence. Slaven Bilic’s strugglers are without James Collins, José Fonte and Sam Byram, while Pablo Zabaleta is suspended. Jacob Steinberg"
226,Burnley,Newcastle United,Sat 28 Oct 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Sean Dyche marks five years in charge at Burnley hoping for just a second home win of the season, against Newcastle. So far Dyche’s side have beaten only Crystal Palace at Turf Moor, and have now slipped below Rafa Benítez’s team in the table. Newcastle will be confident after drawing their last two away matches, and with two conservative defences a draw seems the most likely result on Monday. Paul Wilson"
227,Leicester City,Everton,Sat 28 Oct 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Two of the three Premier League clubs to have sacked their manager this season go head-to-head in the east Midlands as Claude Puel takes charge of Leicester for the first time and David Unsworth seeks the victory that would strengthen his chances of a landing the Everton job permanently. Puel seems likely to keep faith with the Leicester team that ended a six-game winless run with victory at Swansea, which means Shinji Okazaki will play just off Jamie Vardy. Idrissa Gueye is back from suspension for Everton. Stuart James"
228,Brighton & Hove Albion,Southampton,Sat 28 Oct 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"The sides came out of League One together as recently as 2011 and are currently sitting in mid-table, which lowers the tariff slightly and may lead to an entertaining game which both will consider winnable. They have met only once before at the Amex, Brighton winning 3-0 in the Championship, and with seven points from their last four games Albion will fancy a repeat. Mark Tallentire "
229,West Bromwich Albion,Manchester City,Fri 27 Oct 2017 18.11 BST,2017-18,"West Bromwich Albion’s eight-match winless run, in all competitions, stretches back to August and one expects for it to continue against Manchester City. Pep Guardiola made nine changes in midweek, against Wolves, and will want his key men to return to the West Midlands in relentless fashion. Tony Pulis’s only hope could be parking the bus but, without Craig Dawson and possibly Jonny Evans, that is likely to be a serious challenge. Graham Searles"
230,Manchester United,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 27 Oct 2017 18.04 BST,2017-18,"The loss of Harry Kane is a blow for Tottenham and a huge boost for Manchester United. As Manchester City are five points ahead of United and Spurs, second and third respectively, a draw is surely undesirable and given the loss of Spurs’ star striker the onus is on José Mourinho’s men to go for the win. Considering Mourinho’s use of cat-and-mouse tactics it remains to be seen if he will instruct his side to do so. Jamie Jackson"
231,Watford,Stoke City,Fri 27 Oct 2017 17.39 BST,2017-18,"Watford’s defeat in last week’s thriller at Stamford Bridge was perhaps harsh on Marco Silva’s side but it has done little to dampen their belief that this could be a special season at Vicarage Road. The mood is much more solemn for Stoke City, sitting just above the relegation zone; they are yet to win away from home in this campaign. If Watford can match the energy they have displayed so far, the visitor’s barren run on the road may continue. Jack Mumford"
232,Crystal Palace,West Ham United,Fri 27 Oct 2017 17.27 BST,2017-18,"Despite the struggles for both sides, there have been reasons for optimism recently. West Ham’s dramatic comeback at Wembley on Wednesday lifted some pressure on Slaven Bilic while Crystal Palace are back at Selhurst Park for the first time since defeating champions Chelsea. West Ham, as one of four sides still winless away, will be hoping their cup form translates to the league. Jack Mumford"
233,Arsenal,Swansea City,Fri 27 Oct 2017 17.17 BST,2017-18,"Swansea have developed the reputation as a tough nut to crack and it has not gone unnoticed at Arsenal that they have conceded only once on their Premier League travels this season. Arsène Wenger knows that patience will be a virtue but he has demanded that his players show pace and positivity in order to preserve Arsenal’s “impeccable” home record. After a few crashes away from home, he knows the margin for error is zero. David Hytner"
234,Bournemouth,Chelsea,Fri 27 Oct 2017 16.17 BST,2017-18,Antonio Conte will be thankful Richarlison’s profligacy let Chelsea avoid a catastrophic third successive league defeat last week and the Italian will demand improvement against Bournemouth. Eddie Howe is pleased by his side’s upturn in form but even more will need to be squeezed from his players to avoid defeat. Jermain Defoe’s opportunity to score a 200th league goal could be the extra drop required. Graham Searles
235,Liverpool,Huddersfield Town,Fri 27 Oct 2017 15.18 BST,2017-18,"Best friends Jürgen Klopp and David Wagner oppose each other for the first time in the Premier League with contrasting moods around their teams. Huddersfield arrive at Anfield on a high following victory over Manchester United but, having succumbed meekly at Tottenham last weekend, Liverpool desperately need a reaction and yet another defensive improvement. Simon Mignolet’s and Dejan Lovren’s places are under threat while Philippe Coutinho has added to Klopp’s problems with a hip injury. Liverpool have not lost to Huddersfield since a Division Two game in November 1959. Andy Hunter"
236,Tottenham Hotspur,Liverpool,Sat 21 Oct 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"After last week’s bore draw against Manchester United it was important for Liverpool to get a good result in the Champions League and they will look to carry this momentum forward against Spurs. Mauricio Pochettino is happy with Tottenham’s performances, as there were many positives from their draw with Real Madrid at the Bernabéu. It will be tough for Liverpool to beat Spurs, who are undefeated in their past six games. Robin Sargeson"
237,Everton,Arsenal,Sat 21 Oct 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Beating Arsenal at home last season was a turning point for Everton, who went into that 2-1 victory on the back of one win in 11 matches. Ronald Koeman’s side enter the corresponding fixture having won twice in 12 games and with their manager under intense pressure, though it is hard to envisage the repeat that Koeman desperately needs when looking at the attacking options at his disposal. Arsenal require a reaction of their own having been bullied into submission yet again at Watford last weekend. Andy Hunter"
238,Swansea City,Leicester City,Fri 20 Oct 2017 18.43 BST,2017-18,"With Leicester City winless in six games, 18th in the league and without a manager this is a huge opportunity for Swansea City to capitalise and record their third win of the season. In-form Tammy Abraham should relish going up against a Leicester defence that has conceded nine in their barren run. It is likely to be an uphill struggle for Leicester with the players reportedly unhappy about Craig Shakespeare’s sacking. Robin Sargeson"
239,Southampton,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 20 Oct 2017 18.23 BST,2017-18,"These two sides are sitting in mid-table but may feel under pressure by kick-off, when all but one of the teams below them will have played. Southampton have won only once at St Mary’s this season, while West Bromwich Albion are winless in their past six league games. Mauricio Pellegrino will be looking for a repeat performance from the inconsistent Manolo Gabbiadini after his double against Newcastle, while goalkeepers Ben Foster and Boaz Myhill both face late fitness tests for the visitors. Niall McVeigh"
240,Stoke City,Bournemouth,Fri 20 Oct 2017 17.37 BST,2017-18,"Mark Hughes believes that Stoke are doing “slightly better” than expected, after coming through a “difficult period” in which they played Arsenal, Chelsea and both Manchester clubs. Bournemouth have lost six of their eight matches but, after a tough game last week at Spurs, Eddie Howe will look to use tactics that kept Harry Kane and Dele Alli quiet to get a positive result against Stoke. Robin Sargeson"
241,Manchester City,Burnley,Fri 20 Oct 2017 17.21 BST,2017-18,"Burnley are 30-1 to beat Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium due to the Premier League leaders dropping just two points, scoring 29 goals, and blitzing last week’s visitors, Stoke City, 7-2. But Sean Dyche is a shrewd manager and while a victory would be a surprise it would be no shock, given they have already won at Stamford Bridge and drawn at Anfield this season. Jamie Jackson"
242,Huddersfield Town,Manchester United,Fri 20 Oct 2017 16.56 BST,2017-18,"Huddersfield, eager to arrest a decline that has led to them taking one point from their past five matches, were walloped 4-0 by Tottenham Hotspur in their last home game but that does not mean they will park the bus against their latest illustrious visitors. That tends not to be how David Wagner operates, especially with top scorer Steve Mounié available. But the hosts are still likely to spend much of this game on the back foot against Manchester United, who surely will not be as timid as they were last week at Anfield. Paul Doyle"
243,Chelsea,Watford,Fri 20 Oct 2017 16.34 BST,2017-18,"Chelsea have dropped eight points at home this season, already two more than last season, and confront fourth-placed Watford with only one fully fit senior midfielder. Antonio Conte’s side are clearly struggling to adapt to the fixture clutter generated by the Champions League. The visitors’ start will be fuelling their own European desires, with Watford having taken 10 points from four away games to date. This suddenly feels a distinctly awkward fixture for the defending champions. Dominic Fifield"
244,Newcastle United,Crystal Palace,Fri 20 Oct 2017 16.06 BST,2017-18,"Andros Townsend may regard this as an audition for a potential January return to Tyneside as he and his Palace team-mates try to reprise last week’s long-awaited win against Chelsea. Townsend’s old manager, Rafael Benítez, may be more concerned by Wilfried Zaha as he aims to ensure Newcastle bolster the feel-good factor engendered by much fevered take-over talk and collect three points themselves. Roy Hodgson describes Zaha as his “talisman” but Palace’s challenge is to prove they are no one man team. Louise Taylor"
245,Brighton & Hove Albion,Everton,Sat 14 Oct 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Brighton sense a chance to make headway over the next month with West Ham United, Southampton and Swansea City their opponents after the visit of vulnerable Everton. Then again international breaks can sometimes provide timely punctuation and Ronald Koeman will hope his team come out refreshed after taking stock of a deeply unimpressive and troubling September. The television audience in India, who are the beneficiaries of this game’s switch to 1.30pm on Sunday, will doubtless be hoping for a rousing contest too. Everton’s travelling fans would be forgiven for focusing their attention on this latest demonstration of the Premier League’s priorities. Nick Ames"
246,Southampton,Newcastle United,Sat 14 Oct 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Mauricio Pellegrino has endured an indifferent start at Southampton but begins a forgiving run of fixtures with the visit of Newcastle and Rafa Benítez, whom he worked under at Liverpool and Internazionale. Pellegrino has no new injury concerns after the international break, with Shane Long recovering from a hip problem. Newcastle are boosted by the permanent signing of the midfielder Mikel Merino while Jonjo Shelvey is available despite a finger injury. Niall McVeigh"
247,Leicester City,West Bromwich Albion,Sat 14 Oct 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Leicester have had a tricky start to the season in terms of fixtures but their ambitious owners would still have hoped for more than five points from seven matches. The combination of Danny Drinkwater’s late departure and the embarrassing mix-up over the signing of Adrien Silva has left Leicester light in midfield, yet other areas of the team are also not clicking. West Brom, in contrast, were quick out of the blocks, picking up seven points from their first three matches, but have failed to win since. Stuart James"
248,Swansea City,Huddersfield Town,Fri 13 Oct 2017 18.11 BST,2017-18,"Crunch time for Swansea. Paul Clement’s side have lost all three home games, failed to score in five of their seven league matches this season and registered only 11 shots on target. Toothless barely does it justice. Clement said this week that it is too early to talk about a relegation battle but that statement will ring hollow if Swansea pick up anything less than three points against Huddersfield. David Wagner’s side are winless in five but will travel to south Wales with nothing to fear. Stuart James"
249,Tottenham Hotspur,Bournemouth,Fri 13 Oct 2017 17.51 BST,2017-18,"It is a big week for Tottenham Hotspur, with the glamour Champions League tie at Real Madrid on Tuesday and a visit from Liverpool next Sunday but Mauricio Pochettino will not look beyond Bournemouth – and the chance to win at Wembley in the league for the first time. Eddie Howe is not the type to park the bus, which is a good thing for Tottenham. The Bournemouth manager maintains his team can play their way out of trouble. David Hytner"
250,Burnley,West Ham United,Fri 13 Oct 2017 17.06 BST,2017-18,"Burnley’s best start to a top flight season since 1975 has been fuelled mostly by points gained away from home, surprising considering their meagre haul on their travels last season. Sean Dyche will need to record his first Premier League win over West Ham to restore Turf Moor to the fortress it once was, Slaven Bilic’s side have won all four meetings in Burnley’s last couple of seasons at the top level. Paul Wilson"
251,Watford,Arsenal,Fri 13 Oct 2017 16.33 BST,2017-18,"Watford and Arsenal are out of their comfort zones. Marco Silva’s side have not won yet at home and Arsène Wenger’s have not won away from the Emirates. However, it is surely Arsenal that should be more confident, despite in all likelihood missing Alexis Sánchez, of breaking their duck after not conceding a league goal in September. Petr Cech will need to be at his best to keep another clean sheet though as Richarlison is going to be eager to continue impressing. Graham Searles"
252,Manchester City,Stoke City,Fri 13 Oct 2017 16.13 BST,2017-18,Manchester City resume with Sergio Agüero back in contention following the rib injury suffered in a car accident. Factor in how Pep Guardiola’s side beat Chelsea without the striker and they could not be rolling any smoother. A caveat can always be found though: in last season’s corresponding fixture Stoke achieved a creditable 0-0 draw so Mark Hughes knows how to gain a result at the Etihad. Jamie Jackson
253,Liverpool,Manchester United,Fri 13 Oct 2017 15.26 BST,2017-18,"José Mourinho is well equipped to exploit Liverpool’s weaknesses with the power, organisation and counter-attacking style of his joint league leaders but that would require a different strategy to what he successfully employed at Anfield last season. Marouane Fellaini and Paul Pogba are big misses for Manchester United but Sadio Mané’s absence will be felt by Jürgen Klopp, too. Liverpool’s performances have not been as bad as recent results indicate but they can ill-afford to fall 10 points behind their arch rivals so early in the season. Both sides have opportunity to deliver a statement of intent. Andy Hunter"
254,Crystal Palace,Chelsea,Fri 13 Oct 2017 14.41 BST,2017-18,"Chelsea’s momentum had been checked impressively by Manchester City just before the international break but this fixture should provide an opportunity to rediscover lost rhythm. Even in the absence of Álvaro Morata and N’Golo Kanté, they will travel south across the capital and confident Crystal Palace, pointless and scoreless to date, can be overcome. The hosts must do without Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Christian Benteke, but will at least be bolstered by the return of Wilfried Zaha and possibly Julian Speroni to their ranks. At some point they must revive. It may be too much to ask for the recovery to start against Chelsea. Dominic Fifield"
255,Everton,Burnley,Sat 30 Sep 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"The home draw with Apollon Limassol drew the same criticisms for Ronald Koeman that have been around all season and which last Saturday were masked by Oumar Niasse’s late goals against Bournemouth. Thus, for most, the pacy Ademola Lookman and Kevin Mirrallas cannot start soon enough. The defence is out of form too, and Burnley will fancy their chances. Mark Tallentire"
256,Newcastle United,Liverpool,Sat 30 Sep 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"An evocative day for Rafael Benítez who will doubtless be applauded by all corners of St James’ Park before kick-off. While Reds remember the four trophies, Champions League included, he won at Anfield, Newcastle fans are similarly adoring. Benítez duly hopes to delight them by exposing Jürgen Klopp’s short blanket. “I talk about the short blanket,” he said. “If you cover your head, your feet are cold; if you cover your feet, your head is cold. Sometimes when you attack too much, you’re exposed in defence.” Louise Taylor"
257,Arsenal,Brighton & Hove Albion,Sat 30 Sep 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Alexandre Lacazette has been Arsenal’s good luck charm at home this season scoring four in his three appearances, with Arsène Wenger’s side collecting maximum points in the process. So can Brighton stop the Frenchman from extending his streak? Chris Hughton’s side have been typically tight at the back compared to teams around them but the Emirates is their toughest trip to date and West Brom’s failure to thwart Lacazette would suggest Albion will too. Graham Searles"
258,Manchester United,Crystal Palace,Fri 29 Sep 2017 18.39 BST,2017-18,"Manchester United’s season could not have started much better and Crystal Palace’s much worse. United are fresh from Wednesday’s emphatic 4-1 over CSKA Moscow and are second in thePremier L eague only on goal difference, while Palace still search for a first goal and first point after suffering a 5-0 hammering at Manchester City last Saturday. There should, surely, be only one result. Jamie Jackson"
259,Chelsea,Manchester City,Fri 29 Sep 2017 18.22 BST,2017-18,"Chelsea’s complaints about a lack of recovery time after Wednesday’s eye-catching success at Atlético Madrid have been overshadowed somewhat by the untimely loss to injury of Benjamin Mendy and Sergio Agüero for Manchester City. Yet the visitors will still arrive at Stamford Bridge brimming with attacking intent, and Antonio Conte’s side, rejigged or not, will need to rescale the heights of their display at the Wanda Metropolitano to check the leaders’ progress. The suspicion is this could actually end up as fascinating a duel between Conte and Pep Guardiola as the players out on the field. Dominic Fifield"
260,Stoke City,Southampton,Fri 29 Sep 2017 17.25 BST,2017-18,"Stoke City are still severely depleted in defence, with only Kurt Zouma at full fitness, and will likely struggle as they did last week against Chelsea. Mark Hughes does have hope in Southampton’s inability to score with any frequency but his crisis may be the jolt Mauricio Pellegrino’s attackers need to spark them into life. If Stoke do lose again they risk falling into the relegation zone. Graham Searles"
261,Bournemouth,Leicester City,Fri 29 Sep 2017 16.56 BST,2017-18,"Both managers have called for patience before a meeting between two of the league’s bottom four. Eddie Howe will be without Harry Arter and Tyrone Mings, but Callum Wilson has returned to training after a second serious knee injury. Like Howe, Craig Shakespeare can point to respectable performances in tricky fixtures so far, but Leicester will fall into the relegation zone with defeat on the south coast. Jamie Vardy is set to be available despite a hip problem, having scored three goals in six appearances against Bournemouth. Niall McVeigh"
262,Huddersfield Town,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 29 Sep 2017 16.32 BST,2017-18,"While Tottenham’s Wembley teething troubles continue (yet to win in three Premier League games) their away form is the direct opposite with three wins from three, eight goals and a genuine air of title contenders. David Wagner’s Huddersfield – unbeaten at home so far – need to find a way of stopping Harry Kane adding to his tally of 11 goals for club and country in September. Paul Chronnell"
263,West Ham United,Swansea City,Fri 29 Sep 2017 16.13 BST,2017-18,"Slaven Bilic finds himself under far more pressure than Paul Clement even though West Ham only lie a point below Swansea. Bilic desperately needs a win after last week’s defeat to Tottenham and it is likely to be a tense afternoon at the London Stadium. Swansea have lacked a goal threat this season, but they held Spurs and have been tough to break down away from home. Jacob Steinberg"
264,West Bromwich Albion,Watford,Fri 29 Sep 2017 15.59 BST,2017-18,"After a strong start to the season Tony Pulis’s predictable score and shut-up-shop tactics are failing West Bromwich Albion. In all competitions they have scored more than one goal once in eight attempts and that was against Accrington Stanley. Pulis was adamant his side deserved more at Arsenal but the Welshman’s protestations mask his side’s lack of creativity. Watford have no such problem and will be confident they can maintain their impeccable away form, that has yielded nine points from nine, despite missing Nathaniel Chalobah, who requires knee surgery after fracturing a patella. Graham Searles"
265,Brighton & Hove Albion,Newcastle United,Sat 23 Sep 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"The two automatically-promoted sides play at the Amex Stadium with Newcastle, who have won three in a row, are five points ahead of a home side that lost from a leading position at Bournemouth last time out. Has their impressive form merely masked Rafael Benítez’s transfer window frustrations or is something significant gathering speed? Their former manager, Chris Hughton, will put that to the test and Brighton will need to beknow his side need to be as good as they were in their last home game, when Pascal Gross inspired them to a 3-1 win over West Brom. Nick Ames"
266,Arsenal,West Bromwich Albion,Sat 23 Sep 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Arsène Wenger said it all with one of those half-suppressed smirks. “West Brom has a way to deal with everybody,” he said and by that, he meant Tony Pulis has a way to deal with everybody. Wenger vs Pulis is the ultimate clash of styles and how Wenger has suffered in away matches against his rival. The Emirates story is different. Wenger’s record there against Pulis teams reads: played 10, won 10. David Hytner"
267,Swansea City,Watford,Fri 22 Sep 2017 18.30 BST,2017-18,"Contrasting results for these clubs last weekend, Swansea picked up a point at Wembley and Watford were hammered 6-0 at home by Manchester City. Marco Silva’s side, however, have won both of their away games this season while Swansea are pointless and goalless at home. Paul Clement could decide to give Wilfried Bony his first start since returning and Roque Mesa is also pushing for a starting place. Watford, meanwhile, are still without Sebastian Prödl and Younes Kaboul, both of whom are injured, and the suspended Miguel Britos. Stuart James"
268,Leicester City,Liverpool,Fri 22 Sep 2017 18.09 BST,2017-18,"Liverpool visit Leicester City for the second time this week, after losing 2-0 in the Carabao Cup, and Jürgen Klopp has the task of arresting a poor run of two draws and two defeats with 10 goals conceded in all competitions.

Captain Steven Davis has called on Southampton fans to get behind them at a venue where United have won nine times in 12 visits. The trip to St. Mary’s is the first of six away games for United in the next month, and José Mourinho may seek to rotate his attacking options before the trip to CSKA Moscow, with Anthony Martial in form. Niall McVeigh"

273,Everton,Bournemouth,Fri 22 Sep 2017 14.49 BST,2017-18,"Back-to-back wins over Brighton will have lifted Bournemouth’s mood before their visit to Merseyside and Ronald Koeman urgently needs the same following a desperate run of form that has left Everton third from bottom. A more youthful, balanced Everton side ended a run of four defeats with victory over Sunderland in the Carabao Cup in midweek but Koeman is likely to ring the changes again, having viewed last Sunday’s 4-0 defeat at Manchester United as a step forward.

Conte will consider this an opportunity to make a statement in terms of his side’s title defence. Dominic Fifield"
277,Watford,Manchester City,Fri 15 Sep 2017 18.23 BST,2017-18,"Given that Manchester City thrashed Watford 5-0 the last time they visited Vicarage Road, this one may seem a formality. In reality, the circumstances are entirely different this time round. Currently in fourth place with three clean sheets out of four, Watford should be difficult to break down. Indeed, Marco Silva’s side will go top of the league, for a day at least, if they were to win. Joe Cooper"
278,Huddersfield Town,Leicester City,Fri 15 Sep 2017 17.56 BST,2017-18,Leicester face another promoted side after beating Brighton last month and need a win after three defeats against teams in last season’s top five and with Liverpool up twice next week. The Chelsea loanee Kasey Palmer will miss eight weeks with a hamstring injury and Abdelhamid Sabiri stands by after making his Huddersfield debut from the bench in the defeat at West Ham. Mark Tallentire
279,Newcastle United,Stoke City,Fri 15 Sep 2017 17.31 BST,2017-18,"Rafael Benítez will be back in the Newcastle dugout after his hernia-related operation. His return means Mark Hughes can expect a warm welcome. José Mourinho may have declined to shake the Stoke manager’s hand last weekend but Benítez is a Hughes fan. “I don’t have any problems with Mark,” he said. “He’s a good manager, doing a great job. There won’t be any problems.” Louise Taylor"
280,Tottenham Hotspur,Swansea City,Fri 15 Sep 2017 15.58 BST,2017-18,Tottenham are flying after burying their Wembley jinx in the Champions League win over Borussia Dortmund while Swansea City have been gripped by introspection following their failure to perform against Newcastle United. Paul Clement can take heart from how his team have played away from home of late. He knows he needs something special. David Hytner
281,Crystal Palace,Southampton,Fri 15 Sep 2017 15.34 BST,2017-18,"The last time Southampton visited Selhurst Park they confronted a Crystal Palace managed by Alan Pardew and hurting from a six-game losing run. Fraser Forster gifted the hosts an early goal and Pardew won breathing space, albeit for only three weeks. Now, with Pardew, Sam Allardyce and Frank de Boer gone, Roy Hodgson will seek a result just as emphatic. Mauricio Pellegrino had been courted by Palace over the summer only to end up at St Mary’s. Given the upheaval of the last week, he may not know what to expect in south London. Dominic Fifield"
282,West Bromwich Albion,West Ham United,Fri 15 Sep 2017 14.35 BST,2017-18,Slaven Bilic gained a reprieve when his side beat Huddersfield on Monday but his future will be thrust back under the spotlight should West Ham lose at West Brom. Tony Pulis’s side are in need of a response after their good start to the season was derailed following a 3-1 defeat to Premier League newcomers Brighton and it could help that West Ham have conceded 10 goals in three away matches. Joe Cooper
283,Liverpool,Burnley,Fri 15 Sep 2017 13.44 BST,2017-18,"The beginning of Sadio Mané’s three-match suspension opens the door for Philippe Coutinho to make his first start of the season for Liverpool, while Daniel Sturridge is also pushing for inclusion in a side that toiled without the injured Senegal international late last season. Burnley had to wait until 29 April for their first away win last season but they have already collected four points from trips to Chelsea and Tottenham Hotspur. Adding to that tally at Anfield would compound a tough week for Jürgen Klopp. Andy Hunter"
284,West Ham United,Huddersfield Town,Sat 9 Sep 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Slaven Bilic goes into West Ham’s first home game this season knowing that defeat could result in him losing his job. West Ham lie bottom of the table after losing their first three matches and could be distracted by the dispute with Sporting Lisbon over William Carvalho. The mood at the London Stadium will be poisonous if Huddersfield Town, who have adjusted well to the Premier League, increase the pressure on the manager. Jacob Steinberg"
285,Burnley,Crystal Palace,Sat 9 Sep 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Burnley find themselves in the unusual position of still looking for their first home win, having won away at champions Chelsea and held Spurs to a draw at Wembley. They beat Crystal Palace home and away last season, though not easily, and are bound to find Frank de Boer’s side a different proposition, if only because the visitors are desperate to register their first points of the season, or even their first goal. Paul Wilson"
286,Swansea City,Newcastle United,Sat 9 Sep 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"A couple of welcome selection headaches for Paul Clement, who must decide whether Renato Sanches, who had his first Swansea training session on Friday, and Wilfried Bony, who has not made a Premier League appearance since December, should go straight into the team. Newcastle, in contrast, are not sure whether Rafael Benítez will be in the dugout to make any decisions – the Spaniard underwent surgery this week in relation to an infection following a hernia operation. Jonjo Shelvey, a former Swansea player, is available after serving a three-match ban. David Hytner"
287,Leicester City,Chelsea,Fri 8 Sep 2017 18.15 BST,2017-18,"A potentially tricky assignment for Chelsea, who could give Danny Drinkwater his debut at the home of his former club. Antonio Conte must also decide what sort of role Eden Hazard plays now he is available after returning from ankle surgery. Leicester are unable to call on the services of Adrien Silva, who remains in limbo after Fifa refused to approve his transfer from Sporting Lisbon. Robert Huth and Vicente Iborra are also sidelined, although Aleksandar Dragovic, signed on a season-long loan from Bayer Leverkusen, could feature. Stuart James"
288,Everton,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 8 Sep 2017 18.01 BST,2017-18,"This is where it all started for Ronald Koeman, a 1-1 draw on the opening day of last season when Ross Barkley and Erik Lamela got the goals. Neither will feature this time and while Tottenham are bullish as Harry Kane moves into September, the Everton manager’s failure to sign a targetman means he will be hoping Wayne Rooney is not affected by his drink-driving charge. Mark Tallentire"
289,Arsenal,Bournemouth,Fri 8 Sep 2017 17.47 BST,2017-18,"Arsène Wenger says “every defeat is a crisis” and it certainly feels that way for him, as he chugs his way towards a 21st anniversary at Arsenal. The outpouring after the 4-0 humiliation at Liverpool last time out was visceral and everybody knows it will be replicated if they were to lose against Bournemouth – a club that is so far without a point, despite some encouraging performances. For the sake of humanity, Arsenal surely have to win. David Hytner"
290,Stoke City,Manchester United,Fri 8 Sep 2017 17.30 BST,2017-18,"Ryan Shawcross’s back injury could lead to a debut for Stoke’s £18m centre-back, Kevin Wimmer. Even if the Austrian slots in well, United look to have the attacking power to find holes in the home defence, especially out wide. The probability, therefore, is that if Stoke are to disrupt United’s 100% start, then Jack Butland is going to have to show the form that has convinced many that he should be England’s No1. Paul Doyle"
291,Southampton,Watford,Fri 8 Sep 2017 17.13 BST,2017-18,"Not for the first time, Southampton will have been glad to see the transfer window close. Virgil van Dijk is still at the club but this match will come too soon for him. The centre-back Wesley Hoedt could make his first appearance for Saints. The end of the window was less happy for Watford and following Nordin Amrabat’s unexpected departure André Carrillo may take his place on the wingFellow new signing Marvin Zeegelaar and the fit-again Daryl Janmaat and Younès Kaboul give Marco Silva more options in defence. Niall McVeigh"
292,Manchester City,Liverpool,Fri 8 Sep 2017 15.14 BST,2017-18,This should be a feast of attacking play as Pep Guardiola’s possession-based tactics take on Jürgen Klopp’s aggressive forward line. Manchester City and Liverpool each harbour title hopes so this should offer a gauge of how close they may go. Last season’s corresponding match ended 1-1 and two years ago City suffered a 4-1 thrashing. Expect either manager to be jubilant with a mere 1-0 win. Jamie Jackson
293,Brighton & Hove Albion,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 8 Sep 2017 14.33 BST,2017-18,"Brighton are looking for their first win and league goal. There was some encouragement from their performance at Watford before the international break, with Anthony Knockaert making his first start. The worry for Chris Hughton will be that he was not able to sign a forward, which would have added some extra firepower. There were boosts, though, for Shane Duffy and Davy Pröpper who scored for the Republic of Ireland and Holland respectively. However, with Jonny Evans likely to make his first start, West Bromwich will be confident of extending Albion’s goal drought. Jack Kinnersley"
294,Chelsea,Everton,Sat 26 Aug 2017 14.09 BST,2017-18,"Chelsea produced their most scintillating performance of last season in this fixture, tearing Everton to shreds to the tune of five goals. Yet that was a win inspired by Eden Hazard, a player now feeling his way back after an ankle operation, and the visitors are much changed these days. A sterner test awaits this time with the visitors steeled and the champions still to be properly strengthened before the transfer deadline. It would not take a lot to bring a summer of frustration back to the surface. Dominic Fifield"
295,West Bromwich Albion,Stoke City,Sat 26 Aug 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"West Bromwich Albion seem in a hurry to amass their points tally to avoid relegation this season or maybe Tony Pulis has something much grander in mind. Regardless Pulis’s new signings have hit the ground running and, with the addition of Oliver Burke from RB Leipzig, Stoke could be fearing defeat at the Hawthorns. Mark Hughes will hope the shine from his side beating Arsenal has not worn off just yet. Graham Searles"
296,Tottenham Hotspur,Burnley,Sat 26 Aug 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Burnley enjoyed themselves on their trip to London on the opening weekend when they stunned nine-man Chelsea and they intend to further Tottenham’s Wembley woes. Mauricio Pochettino has urged his players to look at the overall performance in the 2-1 defeat to Chelsea rather than the scoreline. He maintains it was good, featuring enough creativity and merely lacking cutting edge. Victory feels essential this time. David Hytner"
297,Liverpool,Arsenal,Sat 26 Aug 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Alexis Sánchez is set for his first appearance of the season and Laurent Koscielny is also available after suspension. Arsenal, on the evidence of their defeat at Stoke City plus Liverpool’s attacking display against Hoffenheim, need both back immediately. Jürgen Klopp’s side recorded a league double over them last season, scoring seven times. The form of Roberto Firmino and Sadio Mané even without the service of Philippe Coutinho looks ominous for a visiting defence who, for all the talk at the end of last season, have changed little. Andy Hunter"
298,Watford,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 25 Aug 2017 18.28 BST,2017-18,"Watford are short of a defender after José Holebas’s red card in the Carabao Cup but Marco Silva will be relieved to suffer the suspension against Brighton. Chris Hughton’s side have yet to score in the league and struggled to beat Barnet on Tuesday. Silva, having already looked to have worked his magic with Watford, will be disappointed by anything other than three points. Graham Searles"
299,Manchester United,Leicester City,Fri 25 Aug 2017 18.03 BST,2017-18,"Manchester United host Leicester City after recording consecutive 4-0 wins but despite that José Mourinho has warned his players that Leicester are back to their title-winning best. But the United juggernaut will take some stopping at Old Trafford, especially as they will be intent on signing off before the international break with momentum maintained. Jamie Jackson"
300,Bournemouth,Manchester City,Fri 25 Aug 2017 17.49 BST,2017-18,"Manchester City have beaten Bournemouth 15-1 on aggregate across their past four meetings, so a visit to the south coast seems the perfect match to remedy the wrongs of Monday night – when they rescued a draw against Everton. Bournemouth are point-less and yet to score in the league, although a midweek EFL Cup win at Birmingham has given Eddie Howe a welcome selection problem. “The positive thing from the week is that several players played well,” the Bournemouth manager said. “I’ll have to think hard about the team I pick.” Ben Fisher"
301,Newcastle United,West Ham United,Fri 25 Aug 2017 16.31 BST,2017-18,"After two league defeats Newcastle could do with a win but will be wary of the aerial threat posed by West Ham’s Andy Carroll on the former local hero’s latest return to Tyneside. If Rafael Benítez has problems, so does his opposite number. Slaven Bilic is well aware of the persistent rumours suggesting West Ham would not be averse to replacing him with a Newcastle counterpart openly unhappy with Mike Ashley’s transfer market parsimony. Louise Taylor"
302,Huddersfield Town,Southampton,Fri 25 Aug 2017 15.07 BST,2017-18,"This promises to be a tough test for Huddersfield, who have yet to drop a point or concede a goal in the league. Southampton may have been knocked out of the Carabao Cup in mid-week with an experimental formation but have won one and drawn one in the league under Mauricio Pellegrino. An entertaining contest looks to be in store. Paul Doyle"
303,Crystal Palace,Swansea City,Fri 25 Aug 2017 14.02 BST,2017-18,"Selhurst Park was the venue for Paul Clement’s first game in charge of Swansea back in January, the recently appointed manager leaving his seat in the stand at half-time to address his players and help inspire a late victory in a relegation scrap. The mood around both clubs suggests another awaits them. Neither has scored a league goal yet. Palace and their new manager, Frank de Boer, will be without Ruben Loftus-Cheek, his best player to date, and must find a way of coaxing some form from Christian Benteke if they are to kickstart their campaign. Dominic Fifield"
304,Tottenham Hotspur,Chelsea,Sat 19 Aug 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"Antonio Conte will be been forced to make changes after last week’s disastrous 3-2 home defeat by Burnley – Gary Cahill and Cesc Fàbregas are both suspended after being sent off. Victor Moses is back following a ban but the Chelsea manager will also be hoping Pedro and summer signing Tiémoué Bakayoko come through fitness tests otherwise his squad, with 26 players out on loan, will be stretched to the limit. Rich Flower"
305,Huddersfield Town,Newcastle United,Sat 19 Aug 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"For their first home match in the top flight since 1972, Huddersfield host Newcastle, who won 3-1 at the John Smith’s Stadium in last season’s Championship. David Wagner’s team are much stronger since then, whereas Newcastle might not be, especially with Jonjo Shelvey suspended and Florian Lejeune out injured. Following last weekend’s win at Crystal Palace, Huddersfield fans will be confident of extending their triumphant start to their Premier League era. Paul Doyle"
306,Manchester City,Everton,Sat 19 Aug 2017 08.59 BST,2017-18,"After the convincing 2-0 win at Brighton in the campaign opener, Manchester City face a sterner test in Everton. Pep Guardiola’s default system may now be a back three which is why the West Bromwich Albion central defender Jonny Evans is being pursued. The last time City faced Ronald Koeman’s side they suffered a 4-0 defeat at Goodison Park. The corresponding home league game was a 1-1 draw City dominated, so the manager will hope that match, not January’s reverse, is an augury of Monday’s meeting. Jamie Jackson"
307,Stoke City,Arsenal,Fri 18 Aug 2017 18.36 BST,2017-18,"Stoke City’s recruitment of Jesé Rodríguez on a season-long loan from Paris Saint-Germain means Mark Hughes now has five Champions League winners in his squad, more than any other Premier League club. The winger is expected to be involved at some stage against Arsenal, 4-1 winners here in May and eager to secure a return to Europe’s elite club competition after finishing fifth last season. Rich Flower"
308,Burnley,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 18 Aug 2017 18.00 BST,2017-18,"Burnley have never made a better start to a Premier League campaign, or perhaps any campaign. It took them 18 games to win away last season and now they have recorded one at the first attempt, at the home of the champions, no less. Expectations will be high at Turf Moor but Tony Pulis’s side are unlikely to fall apart like Chelsea. The two sides appear evenly matched, and while Albion’s away form is not great either, it would not be an enormous surprise to see the points shared, as happened last season when Burnley came back down to earth after their win at Crystal Palace. Paul Wilson"
309,Bournemouth,Watford,Fri 18 Aug 2017 17.39 BST,2017-18,"Eddie Howe will be looking for a reaction from his side after an underwhelming performance in the 1-0 defeat by West Bromwich Albion last weekend. Jermain Defoe could make his first start for Bournemouth since May 2001 and Jordon Ibe may return to the starting lineup. “We need to get our momentum going and get our tempo going and if we can do that then hopefully we will get a result,” Howe said. Watford, who drew 3-3 with Liverpool in their entertaining season opener, should have their captain, Troy Deeney, available following groin surgery. Ben Fisher"
310,Swansea City,Manchester United,Fri 18 Aug 2017 17.08 BST,2017-18,"Everything fell into place for Manchester United against West Ham last Sunday and it will be a surprise if José Mourinho’s team fail to pick up another three points . Mourinho’s only real selection dilemma revolves around whether he should set up a bit more conservatively away from home and recall Ander Herrera. As for Swansea, they are still without Fernando Llorente, who is building up his fitness after breaking an arm. Roque Mesa could make his debut in place of Leon Britton, who is struggling with a back problem. Stuart James"
311,Leicester City,Brighton & Hove Albion,Fri 18 Aug 2017 14.51 BST,2017-18,"After opening the season with defeats, both clubs will be keen to get points on the board. Leicester let victory slip through their fingers against Arsenal while Brighton could only hold out for so long against Manchester City. Keeping Jamie Vardy quiet will be the main task for Brighton after the England international scored twice in a superb individual performance at Arsenal. Kelechi Iheanacho, who was signed from Manchester City to play alongside Vardy, remains troubled by a toe complaint. Izzy Brown, who has a hamstring problem, is out for Brighton. Stuart James"
312,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Fri 18 Aug 2017 14.30 BST,2017-18,"Crystal Palace can become only the fourth visiting team in history to win four successive league games at Anfield but it will take a major transformation from the opening day to achieve that feat. A 3-0 home defeat by newly promoted Huddersfield Town represented a galling start for new manager, Frank de Boer, who also lost Wilfried Zaha to injury, while Liverpool will be looking to build on a valuable Champions League play-off win at Hoffenheim on Tuesday. That exhausting first leg may prompt changes by Jürgen Klopp before next week’s return, though his options appear limited. Andy Hunter"
313,Southampton,West Ham United,Fri 18 Aug 2017 14.14 BST,2017-18,"Mauricio Pellegrino has few injury concerns for a fixture that has been switched to St Mary’s with the London Stadium not ready after the world championships. Ryan Bertrand has recovered from a knock, while Cédric Soares should start despite reported interest from Chelsea. Southampton are under new ownership and insist that Virgil van Dijk will stay, although the Dutchman remains unavailable for this game. For West Ham, Michail Antonio is fit again after four months out with a hamstring injury. Slaven Bilic will be targeting defensive improvement against a team without a home goal in six league games. Niall McVeigh"
314,Newcastle United,Tottenham Hotspur,Sat 12 Aug 2017 09.00 BST,2017-18,"The joy of Newcastle United’s return to the Premier League with Rafael Benítez appears tarnished by Mike Ashley’s puzzling parsimony while Tottenham’s Mauricio Pochettino has transfer market problems of his own. No matter; this remains an enticing, and intriguing, fixture, particularly as Spurs will presumably want revenge for their 5-1 thrashing here in May 2016. Given the chasm in quality between the two squads few are respecting a repeat of that scoreline; indeed Benítez would probably be happy with a point in front of another full house. Louise Taylor"
315,Manchester United,West Ham United,Sat 12 Aug 2017 08.59 BST,2017-18,"Manchester United lost only once at home last season but 15 draws meant they finished sixth. One of the draws was November’s 1-1 with West Ham so what José Mourinho does not want is a repeat. Losing to Slaven Bilic’s side would be unthinkable but having spent £75m on Romelu Lukaku, £31m on Victor Lindelof and around £40m on Nemanja Matic this should not occur. Jamie Jackson"
316,Brighton & Hove Albion,Manchester City,Fri 11 Aug 2017 18.51 BST,2017-18,"Brighton make their long-awaited Premier League debut knowing that, while a match against Manchester City may be considered a free hit, home form will be crucial to their survival. A previously slow summer of transfer activity stepped up this week with the arrivals of Davy Pröpper from Ajax and, imminently, the Club Brugge winger José Izquierdo but City have left most others in the dust when it comes to expenditure during this window and Pep Guardiola will want his own side to set down a marker early on. Nick Ames"
317,West Bromwich Albion,Bournemouth,Fri 11 Aug 2017 18.33 BST,2017-18,"One point and one place separated these teams last season but Bournemouth only stole into ninth position following West Bromwich Albion’s traditional slide into summer once safety had been assured. Tony Pulis’s side took only two points from their last nine games and have not won since mid-March. Do not bet against Pulis, the arch-pragmatist, rectifying that in this match against Eddie Howe’s improving but still unpredictable side. Paul Chronnell"
318,Crystal Palace,Huddersfield Town,Fri 11 Aug 2017 18.22 BST,2017-18,"Huddersfield Town will field several new signings in their first top-flight match for 45 years. David Wagner may start Tom Ince, Mathias Jorgensen, Jonas Lossl and Steve Mounié as he embarks on a quest to keep the relegation favourites in the Premier League. Frank de Boer’s first Crystal Palace lineup are set to have a youthful flavour, with Timothy Fosu-Mensah, Ruben Loftus-Cheek and Jairo Riedewald in contention. Rich Flower"
319,Watford,Liverpool,Fri 11 Aug 2017 17.58 BST,2017-18,"Philippe Coutinho may be the main conversation topic but he will not be on the pitch – the Brazilian is out with a back problem. Liverpool are also without Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridgedue to injury. They travel to Vicarage Road uncertain of what kind of opponents they will face in Watford, now managed by Marco Silva and with seven new signings jostling for places. One of those, record transfer Andre Gray, looks certain to start up front in the absence of the injured Troy Deeney while Nathaniel Chalobah is likely to anchor midfield after permanently returning to the club where he played on loan five seasons ago. Paul MacInnes"
320,Chelsea,Burnley,Fri 11 Aug 2017 17.06 BST,2017-18,"Victor Moses’s red card in the FA Cup final means he is suspended for Chelsea’s first league game of the season. César Azpilicueta will switch to the right with the new signing Antonio Rüdiger coming in to the back three. Álvaro Morata, another new recruit, will lead the line now Diego Costa is out of favour. Burnley will miss Michael Keane in defence while Jon Walters will have a tough task replacing Andre Gray up front. Rich Flower"
321,Everton,Stoke City,Fri 11 Aug 2017 15.31 BST,2017-18,"There could be 10 new signings on display across both teams on the opening day of the season at Goodison Park yet Ronald Koeman and Mark Hughes would prefer more as their respective pursuits of Gylfi Sigurdsson and Bruno Martins Indi drag on. The rebuilding of Everton and Stoke may be incomplete but both managers have the immediate task of getting a new-look team to gel. Next up for Koeman are Manchester City, Chelsea, Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United so a good start is imperative. Andy Hunter"
322,Southampton,Swansea City,Fri 11 Aug 2017 13.37 BST,2017-18,"This will be Mauricio Pellegrino’s first match in charge at St Mary’s but the 90 or so minutes will inevitably be overshadowed by missing parties. Neither the Southampton captain, Virgil van Dijk, or Swansea City’s playmaker, Gylfi Sigurdsson, will feature with question marks over their futures. Saints’ record signing, Mario Lemina, could make his debut after joining from Juventus on Tuesday and Pellegrino’s other summer signing, Jan Bednarek, could also feature. The 19-year-old striker Tammy Abraham is expected to lead the line on his full Swansea debut. Ben Fisher"
323,Arsenal,Leicester City,Thu 10 Aug 2017 19.51 BST,2017-18,"There remain a number of question marks around Arsenal’s makeup for the new season. Have they seen the last of Alexis Sánchez? When will they be able to field their first-choice defence? But it still appears to be a more stable environment than the one in which they began last season. They lost, crucially as it turned out, to Liverpool on the opening day; Arsène Wenger knows a fast start is important this time around to make the idea of a new beginning more sellable and he will be buoyed by aspects of the Community Shield performance against Chelsea. His team look especially lively down the flanks: can they conjure up a nerve-settling early goal for their big signing, Alexandre Lacazette, or will Leicester’s own new boy Kelechi Iheanacho steal the show? Nick Ames"
325,Arsenal,Chelsea,Fri 26 May 2017 18.28 BST,2016-17,"The Double is on for Antonio Conte and it is clear Chelsea must be considered favourites, given the season they have had. Arsène Wenger is unconcerned. He knows the underdog can have its day and he referenced the 2005 FA Cup final, when his Arsenal team “had no players available” but somehow beat Manchester United. It could be Diego Costa’s last game in Chelsea colours but probably will not be Wenger’s last at Arsenal. David Hytner"
326,Swansea City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 19 May 2017 18.45 BST,2016-17,Swansea are on a high after securing top-flight survival last week and Paul Clement will want to end the campaign with a win in front of their own supporters as well as climbing as high in the table as possible – every place is worth around £2m in extra prize money. Tony Pulis will be hoping to arrest an alarming slump that has seen West Bromwich Albion fail to record a victory since 18 March. Rich Flower
327,Arsenal,Everton,Fri 19 May 2017 18.35 BST,2016-17,"The sweet relief of knowing whether Arsène Wenger intends to remain the manager of Arsenal is close. But before the hyperbole ends Arsenal will attempt to complete their mistimed excellent run of form against Everton. They have a chance of qualifying for the Champions League but only if Liverpool or Manchester City slip up. If not, Arsenal will join Everton in the Europa League. Graham Searles"
328,Hull City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 19 May 2017 18.14 BST,2016-17,"Tottenham travel to relegated Hull City with Harry Kane eager to secure the Golden Boot for a second successive season. The England international is in pole position after his four goals at Leicester took him to 26 in the league, two clear of Romelu Lukaku. For Hull, if nothing else, some of the players will be looking to put themselves in the shop window before the transfer window opens. Freddie Paxton"
329,Watford,Manchester City,Fri 19 May 2017 17.56 BST,2016-17,Manchester City need a point against Watford to ensure Champions League football next season and it would be a disaster if events somehow conspired against Pep Guardiola’s side. Recent results have been awful for Watford with the club on for their longest losing streak in 44 years if they fall to City. Walter Mazzarri’s farewell could be brief after never really ingratiating himself with fans. Graham Searles
330,Liverpool,Middlesbrough,Fri 19 May 2017 17.30 BST,2016-17,"The task is simple for Jürgen Klopp’s side: beat an already relegated opponent on home soil, one that has not won a league game at Anfield since 1976 and has won only once on the road this season, and qualification for the Champions League will be confirmed. So why is there anxiety around Liverpool before Middlesbrough’s visit? That is simple too. Liverpool have not won at home since losing Sadio Mané to injury in the Merseyside derby in April and have often struggled against the lesser lights this season, although they won comfortably at the Riverside in December. Andy Hunter"
331,Chelsea,Sunderland,Fri 19 May 2017 17.16 BST,2016-17,"Top meets bottom on Sunday and, while the end of this season will feel like a mercy for Sunderland, Chelsea will consider their post-match celebrations the start of something potentially special. Gary Cahill and the departing John Terry will lift the Premier League trophy after the game with the FA Cup final and further squad strengthening to come this summer. Antonio Conte and the club are determined to capitalise on this success. The future is starker for David Moyes and those from Wearside but their own close season of re-structuring awaits. Dominic Fifield"
332,Southampton,Stoke City,Fri 19 May 2017 16.28 BST,2016-17,"Stoke have long since had little to play for and have won only one of their past 10 games, having seemingly switched off. Southampton’s form has also been underwhelming with one win in seven and Claude Puel faces questions over his future. Both sides have a point to prove and will be eager to give their fans something to cheer. Southampton will be without Shane Long who has a broken metatarsal. Freddie Paxton"
333,Leicester City,Bournemouth,Fri 19 May 2017 16.13 BST,2016-17,Leicester host Bournemouth in a match that will decide which club finishes in the top half. Craig Shakespeare’s side have salvaged their season but could be waving goodbye to Riyad Mahrez and Kasper Schmeichel come full time at the King Power Stadium. Bournemouth have done remarkably well this term and finishing above last season’s champions Leicester would be a triumph. Freddie Paxton
334,Burnley,West Ham United,Fri 19 May 2017 15.49 BST,2016-17,Tony Pulis recently described Sean Dyche as “one of the league’s top three managers” and his achievement in securing Burnley’s first consecutive season of top-flight football since the 1970s is certainly an impressive one. West Ham have had a disappointing season and Slaven Bilic will be well aware defeat on the final day will do nothing for his long-term future at the club. Both sides would receive additional financial rewards if they were to win and leapfrog those above them. Freddie Paxton
335,Manchester United,Crystal Palace,Fri 19 May 2017 14.20 BST,2016-17,"José Mourinho’s complaint about Manchester United’s number of games has been aired yet again, the manager saying they have played “37 games” since January. Crystal Palace will hardly care and in a meaningless match Mourinho will pray Paul Pogba, who has to play owing to rustiness, does not go down injured before Wednesday night’s Europa League final against Ajax in Stockholm. Jamie Jackson"
336,Tottenham Hotspur,Manchester United,Sat 13 May 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"After 118 years, Tottenham are to bring down the curtain on White Hart Lane and nostalgia will be in the air, particularly with the club having planned a grand post-match ceremony. Mauricio Pochettino wants to give the old place the send-off it deserves, with what would be a 17th consecutive win in all competitions. Tottenham are unbeaten at the Lane this season and José Mourinho has made it plain that Manchester United’s priority is the Europa League. David Hytner"
337,West Ham United,Liverpool,Sat 13 May 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"Liverpool have toiled at Anfield recently, but their away form offers encouragement before a tricky London Stadium test. With the top-four race increasingly hard to read, a fourth successive away win would calm Liverpool’s nerves. West Ham, however, are poised to trip them up after last week’s win over Tottenham. Slaven Bilic is yet to lose to Jürgen Klopp in four meetings. Jacob Steinberg"
338,Crystal Palace,Hull City,Sat 13 May 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"There is a vague possibility Crystal Palace could effectively be safe come kick-off on Sunday lunchtime but, more probably, they will remain on edge and this will be an excruciatingly tense occasion. Hull’s predicament – chasing Swansea with a notably inferior goal difference to boot – means they simply have to win. Their away record is the worst in the division, but Palace are the most obliging at home with 11 defeats to date. A 12th would thrust them to the brink of the Championship given a final day trip to Old Trafford. Nerves will be frayed. Dominic Fifield"
339,Bournemouth,Burnley,Fri 12 May 2017 18.55 BST,2016-17,"Both sides were tipped for relegation but Bournemouth can secure their highest ever finish in the club’s 118-year history with a point against Burnley and Sean Dyche’s side have already guaranteed their best finish since 1975. However, Eddie Howe will surely be looking for three points to aid their bid for a top-half finish and with the prolific Joshua King starting they have a great chance. Graham Searles"
340,Stoke City,Arsenal,Fri 12 May 2017 17.24 BST,2016-17,Arsenal have not won at Stoke for seven years and ordinarily this might look the least appetising of away fixtures as they continue their late revival in the Champions League shake-up. But the Potters have won only once in their last nine games and a bottom-half finish looks increasingly likely. That will only count as regression when Mark Hughes’s performance is assessed at the season’s end but they can at least show that some things remain the same with a rousing performance against opponents that tend to bring the bet365 Stadium to life.
341,Manchester City,Leicester City,Fri 12 May 2017 17.13 BST,2016-17,"Manchester City lost December’s reverse fixture 4-2 and six months later the jury remains out on Pep Guardiola as they continue to fight for a Champions League berth. The Catalan believes Leicester will again try and counter-attack but he will also have known that in the pre-Christmas game. It did not allow his men to stymie Leicester then, so the hope will be that Vincent Kompany’s recent return can make a difference as he was missing for that last meeting. Jamie Jackson"
342,Middlesbrough,Southampton,Fri 12 May 2017 14.36 BST,2016-17,"With Middlesbrough down and Southampton mid-table it all looks slightly meaningless but the two managers, at least, have much to play for. While Claude Puel, puzzlingly “under pressure” on the south coast intends to convince his board to keep him on next season, Steve Agnew, Boro’s interim boss is hoping against hope that, come August, he might still be in charge in the Championship. Was it really only a year ago that Aitor Karanka’s Boro were celebrating promotion here? Louise Taylor"
343,Sunderland,Swansea City,Fri 12 May 2017 14.19 BST,2016-17,"A day of farewells for Sunderland – Jermain Defoe and Jordan Pickford surely making their final appearances at the Stadium of Light and season ticket holders saying goodbye to the Premier League – offers Swansea a chance to take a significant step towards safety. Already relegated, David Moyes’s side have not won a game here since mid-December but they sprung a surprise by beating Hull last Saturday. Could Paul Clement’s side be in for a similarly nasty shock? Louise Taylor"
344,Chelsea,Middlesbrough,Sun 7 May 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"Middlesbrough tested Chelsea severely at the Riverside stadium late in November but go into this match acutely aware that their Premier League status could be surrendered if they do not conjure an improbable win on Monday. There will be no let up from the league leaders with the finishing line in sight, though Antonio Conte will be wary of the potential absence of David Luiz and N’Golo Kanté after knocks. “There will be two teams desperate for a result on Monday,” said the Italian. “For this reason, we will see a really good game on Monday.” Dominic Fifield"
345,Arsenal,Manchester United,Sat 6 May 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"It is the statistic that needles Arsène Wenger. In 15 competitive matches, the Arsenal managerArsène Wenger is still to defeat José Mourinho. Wenger has talked about being open to a truce with his long-time adversary but what he really wants is a victory over him. If it happened, the top-four picture would look a lot brighter for Arsenal. Anything less and it could be over. Manchester United’s Europa League semi-final with Celta Vigo may colour the selection of their side. David Hytner"
346,Liverpool,Southampton,Sat 6 May 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"Jürgen Klopp denies Liverpool struggle at Anfield – saying it was just “the moments” that let Bournemouth and Crystal Palace to take points from the last two home games – but they do have a problem with Southampton. This will be the seventh meeting between the sides in the past two seasons. Liverpool have won only once so far, a 6-1 rout in the Capital One Cup, and have not scored in three games against Claude Puel’s team this term. Philippe Coutinho is on course to recover from the dead leg suffered at Watford on Monday, with the home needing to hold their nerve in the race for Champions League qualification. Andy Hunter"
347,Leicester City,Watford,Fri 5 May 2017 18.40 BST,2016-17,"With 40 points apiece on the board, there is little to choose between these two clubs in the league table, yet everything points to a win for the outgoing Premier League champions. With Jamie Vardy scoring freely, Leicester are marching on under Craig Shakespeare and targeting a top-10 finish. Watford have similar ambitions but have lost their past four away matches without scoring and may start to get a little twitchy if they are not mathematically safe after this weekend. Stuart James"
348,Hull City,Sunderland,Fri 5 May 2017 18.19 BST,2016-17,"Sunderland may be down but they will also play a big part in who goes with them as they follow this with a visit from Swansea, who would be five points adrift at 5pm if Hull record their seventh win from Marco Silva’s eight home games. David Moyes has intimated he is staying at Sunderland and knows what has to be done to get them back up, which suggests a mass clear-out. Mark Tallentire"
349,Swansea City,Everton,Fri 5 May 2017 18.01 BST,2016-17,"A huge game for Swansea, who could be five points behind Hull by the time they kick off at 5.30pm. Either way, Everton’s visit seems like must-win territory for Paul Clement’s side, who have regained some confidence by beating Stoke and then drawing at Old Trafford last Sunday. Everton, on the face of it, have little to play for and their away record – winless in their past six matches – is nothing to write home about. Swansea, though, have never beaten Everton at home. Stuart James"
350,Manchester City,Crystal Palace,Fri 5 May 2017 16.12 BST,2016-17,"As the final four games of Pep Guardiola’s first Premier League campaign are embarked upon Manchester City were not supposed to be merely fighting for a Champions League berth. But this is the unwanted scenario and, with Sam Allardyce’s Crystal Palace still not quite safe from relegation, this may prove a tricky contest for the home side, who are without Sergio Agüero. Jamie Jackson"
351,Burnley,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 5 May 2017 15.40 BST,2016-17,"A first away win of the season at Crystal Palace brought Burnley to the verge of guaranteed survival and in truth it would take quite a turn of events for them to be endangered now. One more point would take them to the vaunted 40 mark and they should fancy their chances of gaining at least that against a West Bromwich Albion side that, with four consecutive defeats and five games without a goal, has tailed off dramatically. Six places and five points separate the sides but it is not entirely fanciful to imagine Burnley making that ground up over the final few games. Nick Ames"
352,Bournemouth,Stoke City,Fri 5 May 2017 15.18 BST,2016-17,"Tenth hosts 12th with manager Eddie Howe still preaching the importance of mathematically ensuring Bournemouth’s Premier League status. They are nine points clear of relegation, with three games remaining but a much bigger prize looms, a top-half finish. In-form Joshua King, who has scored 12 goals in his last 14 appearances, will again look to showcase his talents against a Stoke team who have not won on the road since January. Ben Fisher"
353,Middlesbrough,Manchester City,Sat 29 Apr 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,Middlesbrough may have enjoyed pushing fellow strugglers – and north-east rivals – Sunderland to the brink of relegation with a 1-0 win in midweek but the three points have come too late to make much difference for Steve Agnew’s side. Boro remain six points from safety and after facing Manchester City they still have games against Chelsea and Liverpool. The chances of a miraculous survival look slim. Rich Flower
354,Everton,Chelsea,Sat 29 Apr 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"A crucial day in the title race begins here where Antonio Conte’s leaders face what appears their toughest remaining league fixture. Everton may be mediocre on the road but they revel in the comforts of home, winning their last eight, with Romelu Lukaku scoring 14 goals in his last nine Goodison appearances. Tottenham will crave a ninth straight win for Ronald Koeman’s team ahead of the north London derby but another wild Conte celebration would be more than justified should Chelsea prevail. Andy Hunter"
355,Tottenham Hotspur,Arsenal,Sat 29 Apr 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,Mauricio Pochettino said he had not heard of “St Totteringham’s Day” – the annual bit of gloating from Arsenal fans about their team’s supremacy over Tottenham. But the Spurs manager is surely about to dismantle it. Win the derby and Spurs will finish above their neighbours for the first time in 22 years. Pochettino wants more. His sights are set on “finishing above all 19 clubs”. He clings to the belief his team could yet reel in Chelsea. David Hytner
356,Watford,Liverpool,Sat 29 Apr 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"The Manchester derby draw has theoretically taken Liverpool’s top-four destiny out of their own hands, unlikely as it is that the Manchester duo will win all their remaining five games. However, following the home defeat to Crystal Palace, Liverpool cannot afford another slip-up at Vicarage Road against a Watford side who have reached 40 points yet look unlikely to get too many more. Yet Jürgen Klopp will have unpleasant memories of last season’s 3-0 mauling at Vicarage Road and it should serve as a warning against complacency. Paul Chronnell"
357,Manchester United,Swansea City,Sat 29 Apr 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"Manchester United’s exhausting season continues against Swansea City, who they defeated 3-1 in November. Zlatan Ibrahimovic (two) and Paul Pogba scored United’s goals but both are injured now. Given that eight players are unavailable, including the suspended Marouane Fellaini, José Mourinho is down to the bare bones before Thursday’s Europa League semi-final trip to Celta Vigo. Swansea are third-bottom and fighting for their lives so this may be a cagey encounter. Jamie Jackson"
358,Stoke City,West Ham United,Fri 28 Apr 2017 18.43 BST,2016-17,"Five defeats in the past six games have put Stoke’s chances of finishing in the top 10 for a fourth successive season in serious jeopardy and West Ham United will move above them in the table with a win. This could bode ill for Mark Hughes, especially after the Stoke manager spoke of “raised expectations” among fans. The visitors will miss the physical presence of Andy Carroll in attack and will be hoping their record signing, André Ayew, can fill the void. Rich Flower"
359,West Bromwich Albion,Leicester City,Fri 28 Apr 2017 17.41 BST,2016-17,"Craig Shakespeare returns to the club where he made more than 100 appearances and worked as community officer, academy coach and reserve coach, even caretaker manager for one game, in search of the three points that would end any relegation fears for Leicester City. West Brom have lost their way a little, losing the last three and failing to score in four successive league matches – five would be a club record. Matt Phillips and Hal Robson-Kanu are out while Wes Morgan is a doubt for Leicester. Stuart James"
360,Sunderland,Bournemouth,Fri 28 Apr 2017 17.04 BST,2016-17,Sunderland will be relegated from the top flight should they lose and 17th-placed Hull City either draw or win against Southampton. David Moyes’s side won at the Vitality Stadium earlier this season and Bournemouth’s away form has been in a slump ever since. Sunderland must be looking at this match as the last possible chance of redemption for the weary fans of Wearside. Jacque Talbot
361,Southampton,Hull City,Fri 28 Apr 2017 16.31 BST,2016-17,"Hull City need an away win having lost six and drawn one of Marco Silva’s seven league trips and can call on Oumar Niasse, who had his red card rescinded for last week’s sending off, as they battle for safety with Swansea, who are at Manchester United on Sunday. Saints are on 40 points, have lost their last two but have yet to knock off if their efforts in the 4-2 defeat at Chelsea are to be believed. Mark Tallentire"
362,Crystal Palace,Burnley,Fri 28 Apr 2017 16.12 BST,2016-17,"Burnley’s quest for an elusive first away win of the season will continue without Joey Barton at Selhurst Park and with recent poor form – one victory in 11 games – anchoring their mood. Yet one more win should ease the lingering nerves at both clubs, and the visitors will hope to exploit Crystal Palace’s crippling injury list at centre-back. Much may depend on how Palace recover from their midweek exertions against Tottenham Hotspur. Dominic Fifield"
363,Arsenal,Manchester City,Sat 22 Apr 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,Pep Guardiola admits Manchester City’s owners may be unhappy with the season even if the FA Cup is won. So imagine how discontented Arsenal fans will be with the embattled Arsène Wenger if he does not claim the trophy. The two league games between these sides ended in victory for City in December and a draw earlier this month. City are seven points ahead of Arsenal in the top flight having played one more match and they enter the tie as favourites. Yet it would be no great surprise if the erratic Gunners turn it on when required. Jamie Jackson
364,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Sat 22 Apr 2017 09.00 BST,2016-17,"Jürgen Klopp felt “pretty alone” when Palace inflicted the first defeat of his Liverpool reign last season and fans headed for the Anfield exits following Scott Dann’s 82nd minute winner. There is no prospect of a repeat, at least in terms of early departures and managerial isolation, with Liverpool in pursuit of Champions League qualification. Joe Gomez could make his first Premier League appearance of the season with Joel Matip, Ragnar Klavan and Lucas Leiva struggling, although Mamadou Sakho’s ineligibility against his parent club represents a greater loss to Palace. Andy Hunter"
365,Burnley,Manchester United,Sat 22 Apr 2017 08.59 BST,2016-17,"José Mourinho is unlikely to take this one lightly even though the effects of playing 120 minutes against Anderlecht on Thursday and significant injuries to Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Marcos Rojo suggest they may struggle. United’s manager is so short of options the club’s captain and record scorer, Wayne Rooney, overlooked as substitute against the Belgian club, may even be pressed into service. Mark Tallentire"
366,Hull City,Watford,Fri 21 Apr 2017 18.03 BST,2016-17,Marco Silva says his players can handle “big pressure” and a win here would give a huge boost to Hull’s hopes of avoiding relegation and transfer some of that pressure on to their survival rivals. Watford are not mathematically safe on 40 points and have some difficult fixtures to come before the end of the season but a 12-point cushion should be enough to ensure their safety. Rich Flower
367,Swansea City,Stoke City,Fri 21 Apr 2017 16.30 BST,2016-17,"While Stoke require more consistency if ninth place is to be theirs this season the real pressure is on Swansea, for whom the winter revival under Paul Clement is starting to look very distant after five defeats in six matches. The games are starting to run out. Clement will have earmarked this one as a good bet for three points and a wildly unpredictable Stoke, for whom Jack Butland could make a long-awaited return from injury, could just as easily oblige as hammer another nail in their coffin. Nick Ames"
368,Bournemouth,Middlesbrough,Fri 21 Apr 2017 16.16 BST,2016-17,"Twenty years ago a Middlesbrough team containing Emerson, Juninho and Fabrizio Ravanelli somehow managed to get relegated and it appears, barring a miracle, Boro will be marking the anniversary with another top-flight demotion. If that miracle is to occur, it must start with a win on Saturday followed by another against Sunderland in midweek. Anything else will surely leave Steve Agnew’s side with too much to do given their nightmarish run-in. Rich Flower"
369,Chelsea,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 21 Apr 2017 15.28 BST,2016-17,"It is impossible to consider this fixture without acknowledging the context of recent twists in the Premier League title race. Where a chasm had gaped only a few weeks ago, now these bitter rivals are separated by a mere four points ahead of tricky midweek matches. The FA Cup semi-final is an opportunity to inflict psychological damage, with Tottenham seeking to extend an eight-game winning streak and Chelsea hoping to put last weekend’s anaemic display at Manchester United behind them. Something has to give. Dominic Fifield"
370,West Ham United,Everton,Fri 21 Apr 2017 14.02 BST,2016-17,"Although they are nine points above the bottom three, West Ham cannot relax yet. Slaven Bilic’s options have been limited by Andy Carroll’s groin injury and suspensions to Sam Byram and Mark Noble, while another concern for the manager must be Romelu Lukaku’s record against his side. The Everton forward has scored in each of his past nine matches against the Hammers. Jacob Steinberg"
371,Manchester United,Chelsea,Sat 15 Apr 2017 10.00 BST,2016-17,"Whatever José Mourinho says publicly he will want to beat his former side, especially given the 4-0 humiliation in October’s reverse fixture. After he called out all five attackers fielded in Thursday’s 1-1 draw at Anderlecht, Sunday’s question is how they will respond against Chelsea. To hear Zlatan Ibrahimovic named in this group was a surprise as without his 28 goals how dismal might United’s season have been? Jamie Jackson"
372,Middlesbrough,Arsenal,Sat 15 Apr 2017 10.00 BST,2016-17,"Arsène Wenger may think he has problems at Arsenal but Middlesbrough really are in trouble. The only side in English league football not to have registered a win during 2017, their last top-flight victory (against Swansea) was on 17 December. Wenger meanwhile acknowledges that a top-four finish represents “a massive challenge” for his stumbling team, conceding “we might do it, we might not”. The odds on both he and Boro’s Steve Agnew remaining in charge of these clubs come August appear pretty slender. Louise Taylor"
373,Watford,Swansea City,Fri 14 Apr 2017 18.40 BST,2016-17,"To say that Swansea need a win is an understatement. A horror run of one point from five games has put Paul Clement’s side back in the bottom three after an initial revival under their new manager. Watford, with a defence hampered by injury and suspension, lost 4-0 at Tottenham last week and look vulnerable but Swansea were abject at West Ham and need to shed their anxiety if they are to prosper. Rich Flower"
374,West Bromwich Albion,Liverpool,Fri 14 Apr 2017 18.33 BST,2016-17,"A Champions League place next season is very much in Liverpool’s hands, but after dropping points against Bournemouth and the scare last time out at Stoke nobody at Anfield is counting any chickens. That is probably a good mindset for a visit to The Hawthorns, where Tony Pulis’s side easily duffed up Arsenal last month and will be sure to test the Merseysiders’ defensive resolve. Paul Chronnell"

The goalkeeper is likely to be on the bench, particularly as Shay Given is a doubt with a minor back complaint. Hull, who have dragged themselves out of the bottom three with a remarkable revival under Marco Silva, have won away from home only once all season but will fancy their chances against a team who have lost their last four games. Rich Flower"
376,Southampton,Manchester City,Fri 14 Apr 2017 18.06 BST,2016-17,"Claude Puel will be delighted if Manolo Gabbiadini returns – the Italian had scored nine times in his past eight games in all competitions for Napoli and Southampton before suffering a groin injury. It will be interesting to see if Pierre-Emile Hojbjerg, nurtured by Pep Guardiola at Bayern Munich and described by Puel as the “future” of Southampton, keeps his place against the side managed by his former mentor now that the club captain, Steven Davis, is approaching full fitness. Rich Flower"
377,Tottenham Hotspur,Bournemouth,Fri 14 Apr 2017 16.05 BST,2016-17,"Mauricio Pochettino continues to look no further than the next game and at his own team. He says the prospect of Tottenham finishing above Arsenal is not on his mind and nor is ramping up the pressure on the leaders, Chelsea. Yet victory here would put both notions into sharper focus.

Bilic, who could do with a win here as he endeavours to convince West Ham’s board that he remains the right man to lead them next season, may yet succeed in recruiting the England striker this summer, while Lamine Koné, David Moyes’s key centre-back, is another name on his shopping list. Louise Taylor"
379,Everton,Burnley,Fri 14 Apr 2017 15.36 BST,2016-17,"Sean Dyche is still searching for a first away win of the season to complement Burnley’s homegrown case for Premier League survival and it would constitute a minor shock should it arrive here on Saturday afternoon. Everton have won their past seven home matches while Romelu Lukaku has scored in eight consecutive Goodison games – a feat last achieved by Fred Pickering in 1965. Ross Barkley is available having suffered no serious injury when attacked in a bar last weekend and Ronald Koeman is expecting a cagey affair. “It will hard to create open chances against them,” the Everton manager said.

The challenge here is to maintain standards against the champions and to climb further from the condemned near the foot of the table. Leicester City will arrive in south London effectively safe and presumably with one eye on Tuesday’s return leg against Atlético Madrid in the Champions League quarter-finals. The hosts will hope they are a team distracted. Dominic Fifield"
381,Everton,Leicester City,Sat 8 Apr 2017 10.00 BST,2016-17,A Champions League quarter-final at Atlético Madrid looms for the champions and rotation poses a dilemma for Craig Shakespeare after having picked a settled side during his flawless start in the job. Leicester’s prospects of a seventh successive victory in all competitions since the departure of Claudio Ranieri have been enhanced by an Everton defence depleted by injury and suspension. Matthew Pennington will replace the suspended Ashley Williams at centre-back with Ronald Koeman claiming: “If we win our next two home games we can challenge for fifth or sixth.” Andy Hunter

Afterwards the pair can compare notes on being rude to broadcast interviewers. Louise Taylor"
383,West Ham United,Swansea City,Fri 7 Apr 2017 18.48 BST,2016-17,"If West Ham lose at home on Saturday Swansea will be only two points behind them and the fear of a humiliating relegation a few months after moving to the London Stadium could well force the club to dispense with the services of Slaven Bilic.

384,Bournemouth,Chelsea,Fri 7 Apr 2017 18.14 BST,2016-17,"Bournemouth are unbeaten in five matches and their manager, Eddie Howe, says they are “feeling good and confident”. They will need all that confidence if they are to overcome Chelsea, who have lost away from home in the top flight only twice this season.

385,Tottenham Hotspur,Watford,Fri 7 Apr 2017 17.49 BST,2016-17,"There was mind games talk at Mauricio Pochettino’s press conference on Friday. What did he make of Antonio Conte’s suggestion that Chelsea had to win whereas it was more of a bonus for Tottenham? “Not interested,” he shot back. “If Chelsea don’t win the Premier League, it will be tough for them to accept,” he added.

They have lost their last three although Mark Hughes has been at pains to suggest this is their most difficult run of the campaign. Relegation is the faintest of concerns but one more victory should banish any such thoughts and set their sights towards the top half once more. At least Liverpool, vulnerable after drawing with Bournemouth and losing Sadio Mané for the rest of the season, are not as daunting a prospect as they might have been. Nick Ames"

390,Middlesbrough,Burnley,Fri 7 Apr 2017 14.25 BST,2016-17,"The good news was that Middlesbrough managed to score a couple of goals at Hull on Wednesday, the bad that they conceded four. Steve Agnew conceded he “didn’t get the balance quite right” so it will be interesting to see whether Boro’s manager reverts to 4-2-3-1 or sticks with 4-4-2. One thing seems certain though; should the home side fail to beat a Burnleyteam still seeking their first away league victory of the season relegation will surely beckon. Louise Taylor"
391,Arsenal,Manchester City,Sat 1 Apr 2017 08.59 BST,2016-17,"If Arsenal were to win, they would close to within four points of Manchester City; with a game in hand on them. The club’s top-four hopes would soar. But this detail appears to have been lost in the build-up, which probably says a lot about where Arsenal are at present – namely, on their worst run of Premier League form under Arsène Wenger. City will arrive hoping to inflict more misery, in what promises to be an open and attacking match. David Hytner"
392,Manchester United,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 31 Mar 2017 18.32 BST,2016-17,"Wayne Rooney is in contention to return, providing a welcome attacking option while Zlatan Ibrahimovic completes his suspension and there are doubts over Juan Mata. United, unbeaten in the league since 23 October, host a side who went into the international break buoyant from their 3-1 defeat of Arsenal, and they have won two of their last three visits to Old Trafford. Stuart Goodwin"
393,Leicester City,Stoke City,Fri 31 Mar 2017 17.59 BST,2016-17,Leicester City have been brilliant since Craig Shakespeare took over and he will become the first British manager to win his first four Premier League games if his side beat Stoke. Mark Hughes’s team are in their usual ninth position – the place they have finished in each of the past three seasons – and will be keen to upset Shakespeare and improve on their record of only three away wins so far in this campaign. Graham Searles
394,Swansea City,Middlesbrough,Fri 31 Mar 2017 17.36 BST,2016-17,"Jonathan Woodgate has been hired as first-team coach and struggling Middlesbrough will look to keep it tight when they face a Swansea side against whom they achieved their last league win, 3-0 in December. “Losing would put them in a difficult situation,” said Swansea’s Paul Clement, who wants to exceed the record 42 points that saw West Ham relegated in 2003. Mark Tallentire"
395,Burnley,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 31 Mar 2017 17.19 BST,2016-17,"Burnley have no reason to fear Tottenham given the way they have set about other top-six opponents at Turf Moor, and after six Premier League games without a win – their longest such run of the season – this would be the right time to bloody another nose. Relegation looks very unlikely and the fixture list is, after this, relatively kind. For the visitors it is a chance to steal a further march on at least one of Manchester City and Arsenal, who trail in their wake and play each other on Sunday. Nick Ames"
396,Watford,Sunderland,Fri 31 Mar 2017 16.20 BST,2016-17,"Every week brings the end closer for Sunderland, now seven points clear of safety. At least that is the way it looks. However, David Moyes’s side have a game in hand and face Watford, who have taken one point from their past four matches. Walter Mazzarri’s injury list shows little sign of abating, with Valon Behrami the latest addition. For Sunderland Lamine Koné is fit while Lee Cattermole has returned to training after six months out. Paul MacInnes"
397,Southampton,Bournemouth,Fri 31 Mar 2017 15.41 BST,2016-17,"After a non-stop start to the season, Southampton have played just three games in 48 days and the visit of Bournemouth may prove the perfect tonic to shake off any rustiness. It is a match-up that is slowly growing in stature, with Southampton taking the points when the two sides last met in December. Bournemouth have never won at St Mary’s and after earning their first Premier League double last time out – against Swansea City – they could record another history-making victory on Saturday evening. Ben Fisher"
398,Liverpool,Everton,Fri 31 Mar 2017 15.29 BST,2016-17,"Liverpool have a proud, 18-year unbeaten home record to protect at Anfield but also a six-point cushion over local rivals who have closed in fast since the turn of the year. Everton’s momentum faces a serious challenge after losing Seamus Coleman, James McCarthy and Ramiro Funes Mori to long-term injury during the international break. Morgan Schneiderlin is also out while Jordan Henderson, Adam Lallana and Daniel Sturridge are unavailable to Jürgen Klopp, who boasts a 100% record in his Merseyside derbies so far. Andy Hunter"
399,Hull City,West Ham United,Fri 31 Mar 2017 14.46 BST,2016-17,"Hull City’s 1-0 defeat to West Ham Utd at the London Stadium might have been one of the unluckiest of the season – three chances off the woodwork which was then named man of the match by Hammers fans – but now Hull have chance for revenge. West Ham have lost three on the bouncein succession and talk of a top half finish has been replaced by whispers about Slaven Bilic’s future. Key players Winston Reid and Michail Antonio are missing for the visitors, while. Marco Silva may have Michael Dawson fit as Hull look to bounce back from a thrashing by Everton. Paul MacInnes"
400,Chelsea,Crystal Palace,Fri 31 Mar 2017 14.22 BST,2016-17,"Antonio Conte said the build-up to this game had been difficult, with fitness doubts surrounding a quartet of players, but he will be privately confident all four will be available as the leaders seek a 14th consecutive home victory. “This is a game of fundamental importance for us,” he offered, albeit with Manchester City due in west London on Wednesday. Crystal Palace’s issues are just as pressing, even after three successive wins and clean sheets. Their win at Stamford Bridge last season was a first since 1982. Even a point this time round would feel like a triumph. Dominic Fifield"
401,Middlesbrough,Manchester United,Sat 18 Mar 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"So there will be no warm reunion between the visiting José Mourinho and his former Real Madrid sidekick Aitor Karanka, after all, the Basque having parted company with Boro on Thursday. Instead Steve Agnew is auditioning for the job of keeping Boro in the top tier and could do with choreographing a first league win since mid-December. To that end he can only hope United are fatigued in the wake of their Thursday night Europa League exertions. Louise Taylor"
402,Tottenham Hotspur,Southampton,Sat 18 Mar 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"For Tottenham, this is the start of another spell without Harry Kane. The last time he was unavailable, they won two out of five in the league, drawing the other three but it still felt as though he was badly missed. Would a similar run now be enough to keep them in pole position for a Champions League finish? Southampton’s top gun is fit and firing – Manolo Gabbiadini has six goals in four matches since his arrival from Napoli. David Hytner"
403,Manchester City,Liverpool,Sat 18 Mar 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"Manchester City have lost 1-0, 3-0, 4-1, and 2-1 in their past four Premier League games against Liverpool so have to reach back to August 2014 for their last win, 3-1 at the Etihad. Now is the time for Pep Guardiola’s side to end this sequence as, firstly, they have just suffered a Champions League elimination and, secondly, if City do win then the gap to Liverpool grows to four points with a match in hand. Jamie Jackson"
404,Everton,Hull City,Fri 17 Mar 2017 18.40 GMT,2016-17,"Amid Romelu Lukaku’s contract stand-off Everton will still be confident of earning a win that would temporarily move Ronald Koeman’s side above Manchester United in sixth place. Hull overcame Merseyside opponents with a 2-0 win over Liverpool in February and Marco Silva’s side will need a similarly robust display to take anything away from Goodison Park, where the hosts have lost just once all season in the league. Joel Rabinowitz"
405,Stoke City,Chelsea,Fri 17 Mar 2017 18.08 GMT,2016-17,"Despite the growing inevitability of the title returning to west London, Antonio Conte will not allow standards to slip as his Chelsea side aim to be crowned champions sooner rather than later. Conte will be wary of the challenge on Saturday having been pushed hard before winning 4-2 at Stamford Bridge on New Year’s Eve against a Stoke side unbeaten in their past eight home games. Joel Rabinowitz"
406,Sunderland,Burnley,Fri 17 Mar 2017 15.48 GMT,2016-17,"David Moyes will hope Jermain Defoe celebrates his richly deserved England recall with a goal or two in what surely is a must-win game if Sunderland are to stay up. Burnley, though, are anxious to register a first away win and will sense opportunity at the home of their bottom-placed hosts. Moyes’s plan for Jan Kirchhoff to play a role has been dashed, the influential midfielder has been ruled out for another four weeks. Louise Taylor"
407,West Bromwich Albion,Arsenal,Fri 17 Mar 2017 15.26 GMT,2016-17,"Arsène Wenger will be hoping to improve on his head-to-head record of one win in seven away games against Tony Pulis when Arsenal visit The Hawthorns. The Frenchman’s side arrive after a bruising run of three defeats in their past four league matches and at risk of being cut adrift from the top four. West Bromwich, however, were complacent in defeat at Everton last week and will need to be much more focused to avoid another one. Joel Rabinowitz"
408,Bournemouth,Swansea City,Fri 17 Mar 2017 15.00 GMT,2016-17,"Bournemouth are in danger of being drawn into a relegation scrap, while Swansea continue their own bid to escape the drop. Josh King’s hat-trick in a chaotic encounter with West Ham gave Eddie Howe’s side their first league win of 2017 last weekend following an eight-game barren streak. Swansea have lost their past three away matches, since winning at Anfield, and travel without key full-backs Kyle Naughton and Martin Olsson. Joel Rabinowitz"
409,West Ham United,Leicester City,Fri 17 Mar 2017 14.21 GMT,2016-17,"Atlético Madrid can wait. Leicester City cannot afford to take their eye off the ball in the Premier League. Three points above the bottom three, they remain in a relegation fight despite reaching the Champions League quarter-finals thanks to Tuesday’s win over Sevilla. Craig Shakespeare will be confident of extending his winning start and West Ham United’s indifferent recent form means a fourth straight win for Leicester could be on the cards. Jacob Steinberg"
410,Crystal Palace,Watford,Fri 17 Mar 2017 13.16 GMT,2016-17,"It is five years to the day since Crystal Palace last beat Watford at Selhurst Park and, given the precarious nature of their position and the fact they face the top six in their remaining fixtures, Sam Allardyce’s side must surely emulate the class of 2012 if they are to survive this time round. Successive wins and clean sheets have given them heart but Patrick van Aanholt’s absence is a blow. Watford have won once away from home since mid-October but are within touching distance of safety and can tap into their hosts’ anxieties. Dominic Fifield"
411,Chelsea,Manchester United,Sun 12 Mar 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"José Mourinho was humiliated on his return to Stamford Bridge back in October, his players humbled 4-0 on the turf and the Manchester United manager taking Antonio Conte’s cheerleading of the home support on the sidelines as a personal slight. His team will be tougher this time, even without the suspended Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but Chelsea will play a stronger side than in previous rounds. They know they can inflict a significant psychological blow if they maintain their push for the Double. Dominic Fifield"
412,Liverpool,Burnley,Sat 11 Mar 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"So, Liverpool beat Arsenal. Now comes a really difficult game, as some would have you believe, but if Jürgen Klopp’s team do not win this there will be some serious head scratching. Sean Dyche’s side will defend in numbers but have not won away this season in any competition. Their best result was October’s goalless draw at Old Trafford; a low was losing at Watford. Conrad Leach"
413,Tottenham Hotspur,Millwall,Sat 11 Mar 2017 08.59 GMT,2016-17,"Tottenham are on the way to Wembley. Next season, for sure – or at least, that is the plan, while their new stadium build is finished. But they are determined to get there for an FA Cup semi-final and to move closer to the first trophy of the Mauricio Pochettino era. It stands to be the last cup tie at White Hart Lane and, amid security concerns, the hope is the action on the field attracts the headlines. David Hytner"
414,Hull City,Swansea City,Fri 10 Mar 2017 18.41 GMT,2016-17,"With one of his leading scorers, Abel Hernández, unlikely to start and the other, Michael Dawson, an injured defender Marco Silva will have to look to the heroes of the 2-0 win at home to Liverpool, Alfred N’Diaye and Oumar Niasse. Swansea were relieved to win last week and their former Spain forward Fernando Llorente, in his best form of the season, is an aerial threat. Conrad Leach"
415,Everton,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 10 Mar 2017 18.10 GMT,2016-17,"Everton’s nine-match unbeaten run was ended by Tottenham last week but Ronald Koeman still believes his side can snatch a top-six spot. If that is to materialise then Everton must win on Saturday. West Bromwich Albion are chasing too, a record points total for the club in the Premier League. Tony Pulis’s miserly defence need to be at their best to keep on track and keep out a man they know all too well, Romelu Lukaku. Graham Searles"
416,Bournemouth,West Ham United,Fri 10 Mar 2017 17.42 GMT,2016-17,"Form-wise Bournemouth are in trouble. Winless in their past nine matches and conceding goals at a worrying rate. However, Eddie Howe’s side will be feeling good after working tirelessly to draw 1-1 at Old Trafford last time out. Equally, West Ham will be buoyed by Michail Antonio’s return. Slaven Bilic can count on Antonio and Andy Carroll terrorising Bournemouth’s shaky defence. Graham Searles"
417,Middlesbrough,Manchester City,Fri 10 Mar 2017 15.27 GMT,2016-17,"With Pep Guardiola’s title chances dashed and Wednesday’s Champions League second leg tie in Monaco a comfortable distance away, City can afford to field a strong side as their manager hunts a first English trophy. With struggling Middlesbrough in a relegation fight, it is a quarter-final Aitor Karanka – an old adversary of Guardiola’s during their days at Real Madrid and Barcelona respectively – could probably do without but Boro had City’s measure when the teams drew at the Etihad in November. Louise Taylor"
418,Arsenal,Lincoln City,Fri 10 Mar 2017 14.44 GMT,2016-17,"Danny Cowley, the Lincoln City manager, says his team are 1000-1 shots. The bookmakers have them at 40-1, or shorter, which probably explains a lot about why bookies never really lose. The bottom line is that the Imps – the first non-league team to reach the FA Cup quarter-finals in 103 years – believe they have a chance, however small. Arsenal got past Sutton United in the last round. Arsène Wenger dare not slip on this latest banana skin. David Hytner"
419,West Ham United,Chelsea,Sun 5 Mar 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"West Ham have beaten Chelsea once this season, edging a tight EFL Cup tie on a fiery night at the London Stadium in October. Crowd trouble marred a fine win for Slaven Bilic’s side and it was a surprise to see this match moved to a late kick-off. West Ham, who will be hoping that Andy Carroll will be fit enough to replace the suspended Michail Antonio up front, will be desperate for the focus to remain on the pitch. Then again, Chelsea are likely to be out for revenge. Jacob Steinberg"
420,Tottenham Hotspur,Everton,Sat 4 Mar 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"Harry Kane versus Romelu Lukaku feels like the juiciest sub-plot; the strikers are leading the race for the Premier League’s Golden Boot this season, together with Arsenal’s Alexis Sánchez. But the bigger picture is the meeting between a Tottenham side that has come to look unbeatable at White Hart Lane and the division’s form side in Everton. Tottenham have won eight straight in the league on their own turf while nobody has a better record than Everton in 2017. Something has to give. David Hytner"
421,Sunderland,Manchester City,Sat 4 Mar 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"Between 2010 and 2013 Sunderland beat City 1-0 four times in succession on Wearside. That quartet of victories all came in league games but it is hard to imagine David Moyes’s side winning this one. Not that Fabio Borini is remotely deterred. “Manchester City seem a bit shaky at the back because of the way Pep Guardiola wants them to play,” says the Sunderland forward who believes his side can exploit this perceived fragility before celebrating a rare win. Louise Taylor"
422,West Bromwich Albion,Crystal Palace,Fri 3 Mar 2017 18.36 GMT,2016-17,"Crystal Palace, who Tony Pulis is still in dispute with, will have the manager’s undivided attention and he will make sure West Brom are ready to extend Sam Allardyce’s stay in the relegation zone. However, the former England manager who, like Pulis, has never been relegated from the Premier League, is sure to be equally focused. Preparation may not be enough, though, as West Brom are enjoying their best-ever spell in the Premier League and will not want the party to end here. Graham Searles"
423,Manchester United,Bournemouth,Fri 3 Mar 2017 17.54 GMT,2016-17,"This weekend is Manchester United’s chance to move up finally from the sixth place they have occupied since early November. As Liverpool play Arsenal on Saturday evening one side, at least, will drop points. This means that, should José Mourinho’s side defeat Bournemouth, they will definitely start the week in fifth whatever the result at Anfield. United last lost in the league at Chelsea in October so this will be a difficult ask for Eddie Howe. Jamie Jackson"
424,Stoke City,Middlesbrough,Fri 3 Mar 2017 17.14 GMT,2016-17,"“One important thing is that they’re in a comfortable position and we need three points,” said the Middlesbrough manager, Aitor Karanka, of this fixture, and while his assessment of Stoke is fair it is one that may grate in the Potteries. Last Sunday’s capitulation at Tottenham was not a good look and the frustration is that Stoke, while well-off in mid-table, never seem quite able to make that next step. The next few weeks will most likely see them shuttling between a nondescript set of places in the middle; should they be hoping for more, or is this their natural ceiling? Nick Ames"
425,Liverpool,Arsenal,Fri 3 Mar 2017 16.23 GMT,2016-17,"Arsène Wenger, in his 50th and possibly last game managing Arsenal against Liverpool, will be looking for an important win in the race for Champions League qualification and to avoid Liverpool securing a league double over the Frenchman for the first time since 2000. Jürgen Klopp will be aware of some pressure growing regarding Liverpool’s slide this year and that may continue without Jordan Henderson. Klopp’s side with the England midfielder win 61.5% of matches and just 33.3% without. Graham Searles"
426,Watford,Southampton,Fri 3 Mar 2017 16.02 GMT,2016-17,"Walter Mazzarri has called for a change in attitude from Watford, saying his side need to “stop sitting back” if they are to win more matches. However, it was no one but the Italian who replaced the injured forward Mauro Zárate with a midfielder at half-time in last week’s draw with West Ham. Zárate is out for the season with knee ligament damage and the Hornets will assess the fitness of Daryl Janmaat who also limped off against the Hammers. Saints will look to bounce back after losing the EFL Cup final when two Manolo Gabbiadini goals were not enough for Claude Puel. Paul MacInnes"
427,Swansea City,Burnley,Fri 3 Mar 2017 14.20 GMT,2016-17,"Paul Clement has transformed Swansea since taking over as manager but the next four games feel critical for the Welsh club, with Burnley’s visit followed by trips to Hull and Bournemouth and a home match against Middlesbrough. Swansea won at Burnley on the opening day, although that result was no indicator for what was to come for either club, with Sean Dyche’s side excellent at home ever since. Luciano Narsingh is pushing for a start for Swansea, while Jeff Hendrick returns from suspension for Burnley. Stuart James"
428,Leicester City,Hull City,Fri 3 Mar 2017 13.14 GMT,2016-17,"After that barnstorming victory over Liverpool on Monday night, when Jamie Vardy said the players were stung by the criticism they had received in the wake of Claudio Ranieri’s sacking, the challenge for Leicester is to reproduce something similar against Hull. Another win would surely lead to Craig Shakespeare being given the job until the end of the season. Hull, however, beat Leicester on the opening day and would move level on points with the champions if they can complete the double over them. Stuart James"
429,Leicester City,Liverpool,Sun 26 Feb 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"It is a little over a year since an outrageous swing of Jamie Vardy’s right boot sent the ball sailing high over Simon Mignolet and it started to dawn that, just possibly, Leicester could actually win the Premier League title. Claudio Ranieri’s exit has given this match a new subplot but the central issue has not changed. The champions are in the bottom three and badly need a victory. Paul Chronnell"
430,Tottenham Hotspur,Stoke City,Sat 25 Feb 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"Tottenham will be keen to move on from their embarrassing Europa League exit at the hands of Gent on Thursday. The familiar surroundings of White Hart Lane should be a boost and it is hard to see Stoke troubling a home side looking to return to Europe’s elite competition next season. Mark Hughes, however, does have a wild card in Saido Berahino who is set to make his first Stoke start. Graham Searles"
431,Manchester United,Southampton,Sat 25 Feb 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"Forty-one years ago Southampton shocked Manchester United by winning the FA Cup final with a 1-0 triumph at Wembley. This remains the south coast club’s only major honour so Claude Puel’s 2017 vintage have the chance to make real history. United are starting to resemble the juggernaut of all Mourinho’s champion sides so they start as firm favourites. The Portuguese also has a fine pedigree in the competition, having won it three previous times. It seems unlikely, then, that Southampton can repeat their 1976 feat. But this is a final and, as they proved, anything can occur. Jamie Jackson"
432,West Bromwich Albion,Bournemouth,Fri 24 Feb 2017 18.19 GMT,2016-17,"After three successive defeats Bournemouth are slipping towards danger and a visit to the Hawthorns is hardly the ideal place to spark a revival. The problem is abundantly clear, Eddie Howe’s side are too vulnerable in defence – conceding 21 goals in their past seven matches in all competitions. Tony Pulis will look to capitalise and if successful West Bromwich Albion will be just nine points behind their record Premier League total. Graham Searles"
433,Watford,West Ham United,Fri 24 Feb 2017 17.51 GMT,2016-17,With 10 points separating Watford from the teams in the relegation zone and West Ham 12 points clear of trouble this could be described as a low-stakes game but Walter Mazzarri will know a 13th-placed finish cost his predecessor his job at Vicarage Road last summer. West Ham’s Andy Carroll looks set to miss out while he continues to recover from a groin injury but Aaron Cresswell returns. Paul MacInnes
434,Hull City,Burnley,Fri 24 Feb 2017 17.10 GMT,2016-17,"What might have been a relegation six-pointer at the beginning of the season is not because Burnley’s home form has been imperious. Their away form continues to be awful though, with just one point earned on their travels. Such travails will not be helped by an injury to Johann Berg Gudmundsson and Jeff Hendrick’s ban. Marco Silva’s resurgent side will be missing Sam Clucas through suspension but are otherwise likely to boast a side unchanged from the one that lost narrowly to Arsenal. Paul MacInnes"
435,Chelsea,Swansea City,Fri 24 Feb 2017 15.17 GMT,2016-17,"Antonio Conte will consider this an opportunity to stretch Chelsea’s imposing lead at the top of the Premier League but Swansea are hugely improved and are now overseen by two former Blues. Claude Makelele will be afforded a huge ovation on his return as one of Paul Clement’s assistants. Carlo Ancelotti’s former No2 has won four of six league games and his side can sense a route to safety. “Now it’s about asking: ‘How much do we want to avoid suffering at the end of the season?’” said Clement. They are eager to secure the points required sooner rather than later, and even a trip to Chelsea will not daunt them. Dominic Fifield"
436,Crystal Palace,Middlesbrough,Fri 24 Feb 2017 15.09 GMT,2016-17,"This may be Crystal Palace’s last chance to turn their season around. Middlesbrough, supremely stingy but without an away win since August, arrive at Selhurst Park hoping to emulate Sunderland’s recent saunter in south London by tapping into Palace’s insecurities at home. Palace, a team on edge even after a fortnight’s break, cannot afford another slip up. “It’s not Middlesbrough we’re playing against,” Sam Allardyce said. “We’re playing against ourselves.” This has to be their moment, or the Championship surely beckons. Dominic Fifield"
437,Everton,Sunderland,Fri 24 Feb 2017 13.49 GMT,2016-17,David Moyes returns to Goodison Park for the first time since a 2-0 defeat in April 2014 marked the end of his reign at Manchester United. He can ill-afford another demoralising match against his former club. Sunderland are anchored to the bottom of the table and will need more than a trip to New York to recover from the 4-0 home defeat by Southampton. Leighton Baines is in line to make his 300th Premier League appearance for Everton. Andy Hunter
438,Sutton United,Arsenal,Sun 19 Feb 2017 13.11 GMT,2016-17,Sutton will have been watching with glee as Bayern Munich destroyed Arsenal on Wednesday night. The result sets the National League side up with a perfect chance to put one over on Arsène Wenger’s side. If they can score an early goal then they will feel as unbeatable as their Munich counterparts. Arsenal should have the class to ruin Sutton’s dream but motivation might be hard to muster. Graham Searles
439,Fulham,Tottenham Hotspur,Sat 18 Feb 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"Fulham, resurgent just outside the play-off positions in the Championship, have beaten Premier League opposition twice this term having seen off Middlesbrough in the EFL Cup and Hull in this competition. Slavisa Jokanovic will hope to make that a hat-trick against a stuttering Tottenham Hotspur. Mauricio Pochettino intends to make changes at Craven Cottage in the hope the fringe players offer some freshness. Spurs have won on their last three trips across the capital, and none of the side who lost 4-0 on their last FA Cup visit here, six years ago, remain at the club. Dominic Fifield"
440,Blackburn Rovers,Manchester United,Sat 18 Feb 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"José Mourinho is starting to mould Manchester United into the kind of winning machine all his best sides resemble. He is intent on taking the competition seriously despite United being in the EFL Cup final, the Europa League, and vying for a top-four finish. All of this means that if beleaguered Blackburn Rovers – second bottom in the Championship and with virtually absent owners, Venky’s – can beat them it will be a bona fide upset. Jamie Jackson"
441,Wolverhampton Wanderers,Chelsea,Fri 17 Feb 2017 18.45 GMT,2016-17,"The natural step for Wolves, after knocking out Stoke City and Liverpool in the third and fourth round, could only ever have been the Premier League leaders Chelsea. Paul Lambert’s side are at home this time and Hélder Costa will be relishing the chance to shine again. Chelsea, however, have a huge amount of talent and will be unmoved by their opponents’ fairytale. Graham Searles"
442,Millwall,Leicester City,Fri 17 Feb 2017 17.48 GMT,2016-17,"Claudio Ranieri has no chance of escaping the crucible this weekend. Leicester are on an abysmal run with no wins in six and five defeats on the bounce in the league. They have not won away since last April either, and now head to the Den to face a Millwall side who have not lost since mid-December. A shock seems even more likely when Leicester’s Champions League tie against Sevilla next week is factored in. Expect wholesale changes from Claudio Ranieri while Millwall face a wait over the fitness of striker Lee Gregory. Paul MacInnes"
443,Burnley,Lincoln City,Fri 17 Feb 2017 17.23 GMT,2016-17,"Sean Dyche will make changes to his Burnley side but there is no danger that he will pitch in youth against National League leaders Lincoln. For one thing, Dyche has a small, experienced squad with few untried players on the fringes; for another, Lincoln have already shown perfectly well in defeating Ipswich and Brighton that they can capitalise when opponents take their eyes off the ball. The smart money is on Burnley’s iron mentality being immune to such slip-ups, although the highly competent Lincoln manager Danny Cowley has the sharpness to exploit any slackness that does seep into the home side. Nick Ames"
444,Middlesbrough,Oxford United,Fri 17 Feb 2017 16.54 GMT,2016-17,"Aitor Karanka knows that, 20 years ago, a Middlesbrough side starring Juninho and Fabrizio Ravanelli combined reaching two cup finals with relegation but said there is “no reason” why his team cannot twin survival with FA Cup glory. After knocking Newcastle out in the fourth round, Michael Appleton’s League One Oxford may prove awkward opponents and all eyes will be on Gastón Ramírez, the Uruguay playmaker is set for his first start since Karanka rejected his January transfer request.

445,Huddersfield,Manchester City,Fri 17 Feb 2017 16.11 GMT,2016-17,"Third in the Championship takes on second in the Premier League. Quite a Cup tie is in prospect at the John Smith’s Stadium, though much will depend on how keen David Wagner is to take a break from chasing promotion to test Huddersfield’s strength against a Manchester City side whose next game will be in the Champions League. Monaco on Tuesday could influence Pep Guardiola’s selection, already compromised through injury to Gabriel Jesus. Paul Wilson"
446,Bournemouth,Manchester City,Sun 12 Feb 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"Manchester City arrive on the south coast in fine fettle after three consecutive wins, including fine attacking displays in their disposal of both Crystal Palace and West Ham United. Bournemouth are another team with a porous defence and one yet to record victory this calendar year. Everything is stacked against Eddie Howe, but his side have a habit of defying the odds, especially at home. Ben Fisher"
447,Burnley,Chelsea,Sat 11 Feb 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"Antonio Conte is right to be wary of Burnley’s formidable home record – the third-best in the league – although Chelsea have a fine habit of switching on against supposed lesser opposition. Burnley are without three first-team midfielders, with Ashley Westwood and Robbie Brady in line to make their first starts. Sean Dyche’s side cannot absorb too many key absences but should have enough willpower to make Chelsea work hard for anything they take away. Nick Ames"
448,Sunderland,Southampton,Fri 10 Feb 2017 18.23 GMT,2016-17,"While rivals head to the Gulf for warm-weather training next week, David Moyes is taking his players on a bonding break to sub-zero, snowy, New York. It seems illogical but as they proved by crushing Crystal Palace away last Saturday, Sunderland have a penchant for the unexpected. Indeed lack of consistency is their primary problem so the visit of a talented yet vulnerable Southampton represents a telling challenge. Can Moyes’s players win again or will they disappoint? Louise Taylor"
449,Swansea City,Leicester City,Fri 10 Feb 2017 17.38 GMT,2016-17,Paul Clement has been named manager of the month for January and Claudio Ranieri has received the dreaded vote of confidence – in that context both men could be forgiven for feeling cursed before this pivotal meeting. It is a huge game for two clubs who are separated only by goal difference. Swansea have won three of their past five league matches. Leicester have lost their last four and have yet to score a league goal this year. Stuart James
450,West Ham United,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 10 Feb 2017 16.58 GMT,2016-17,"West Bromwich travel to West Ham, a place below them in ninth, with the 40-point mark in sight and mid-table a blessing for two teams unlikely to climb much higher. Albion are undefeated in three while the Hammers again have fitness concerns over Andy Carroll, who has not trained all week and needs a goal to become the fifth man to score 30 Premier League goals for them. Mark Tallentire"
451,Stoke City,Crystal Palace,Fri 10 Feb 2017 16.45 GMT,2016-17,"A 4-1 defeat at Selhurst Park in September was the low point of Stoke’s season; Palace travel to the Potteries after their own, more embarrassing, nadir at home to Sunderland and Mark Hughes believes that was the “worst outcome” for his side given the reaction Sam Allardyce will be demanding. Hughes himself would not mind a step up in performance after seeing his team go three games without a win. Nick Ames"
452,Manchester United,Watford,Fri 10 Feb 2017 16.29 GMT,2016-17,"Manchester United are unbeaten in 15 Premier League games yet they remain in sixth position, the place they have been stuck in since early November. The good news is United can start next week in fourth if Liverpool and Arsenal lose their matches on Saturday and United win, the bad news is United went down 3-1 to Watford in the reverse fixture in what was arguably the seasons’s poorest display. Jamie Jackson"
453,Arsenal,Hull City,Fri 10 Feb 2017 15.44 GMT,2016-17,Here we go again. Arsène Wenger can hear the squeals of protest and the problem of whether he ought to stay on at Arsenal dominates the agenda. Wenger only ever seems to be one defeat from crisis. The team have now lost two on the spin and the consequences of another bad result against a Hull team revitalised under Marco Silva do not bear thinking about. David Hytner
454,Liverpool,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 10 Feb 2017 13.13 GMT,2016-17,"Simon Mignolet is not the only Liverpool player uncertain to keep his place following the anaemic display at Hull City as Jürgen Klopp attempts to rectify an alarming run of results. His team have won once in 10, whereas Tottenham are unbeaten in 10 and will go seven points clear of Liverpool with a rare league win at Anfield. The hosts are, however, unbeaten in matches against their top six rivals this season and have not lost to Spurs since November 2012. Andy Hunter"
455,Middlesbrough,Everton,Fri 10 Feb 2017 12.56 GMT,2016-17,"Middlesbrough have just returned from warm-weather training in Benidorm with Aitor Karanka hoping that the break will prove a watershed moment in their relegation fight. Although difficult to beat, Boro have won fewer Premier League games – four – than anyone, with their last victory coming in December. Karanka could probably do without meeting a recently somewhat more direct, higher tempo, Everton, who are very much the division’s form team. Much may hinge on the mood of his recently unsettled playmaker Gaston Ramírez. Louise Taylor"
456,Leicester City,Manchester United,Sat 4 Feb 2017 09.00 GMT,2016-17,"The last time José Mourinho visited the King Power Stadium, in December 2015, he was sacked the following day. That was during his time in charge of Chelsea, when Leicester were on their way to winning the title. It seems like a distant memory now, and it is Ranieri, not Mourinho, who goes into this game under pressure. Depending on results elsewhere, Leicester could be in the bottom three by the time they kick off. United need a win to break a run of three draws. Stuart James"
457,Manchester City,Swansea City,Sat 4 Feb 2017 08.00 GMT,2016-17,Will Pep Guardiola drop Sergio Agüero and Claudio Bravo for a second match in a row? Can the Manchester City manager somehow plot his way to a third win over Swansea City this season? The first question comes after the striker and the No1 keeper were left out for the 4-0 win at West Ham United. The second because Guardiola talked up Paul Clement’s impact since taking over four games ago. Jamie Jackson
458,West Bromwich Albion,Stoke City,Fri 3 Feb 2017 18.38 GMT,2016-17,"“I’ve spent two and a half years at this club and he’s not my problem anymore. I wish him all the best.” These were the words spoken by Tony Pulis on Saido Berahino – the pantomime villain of The Hawthorns after his overdue departure. But, should Berahino enter from stage left for his full Stoke debut, it promises to be a better contest than many may think. Just four points split the sides, who are eighth and ninth respectively. Dan Brown"
459,Southampton,West Ham United,Fri 3 Feb 2017 18.27 GMT,2016-17,"Southampton can be satisfied to have received £8m for a 33-year-old centre-back who was minded to move on but when José Fonte returns to St Mary’s with West Ham, the home club may wish they had been able to hold on to him a little longer. Virgil van Dijk’s injury leaves Claude Puel with few central defensive options. But if Saints manage to plug the gap at the back and take their chances up front they could still have the last laugh. Paul Doyle"
460,Watford,Burnley,Fri 3 Feb 2017 18.10 GMT,2016-17,"Watford, who had looked like spiralling into chaos after a disastrous run of league form and an FA Cup exit to Millwall, now host Burnley on the back of the most unlikely away win of the season at Arsenal. Any away win for Burnley would be unlikely as they are still stuck on just the one point gained away from Turf Moor all season. They will be missing Steven Defour with a hamstring injury but have both their deadline-day signings in Robbie Brady and Ashley Westwood ready for action. Watford will assess Miguel Britos and will be tempted to give the forward M’Baye Niang his second start in five days. Paul MacInnes"
461,Tottenham Hotspur,Middlesbrough,Fri 3 Feb 2017 17.51 GMT,2016-17,"Tottenham have stumbled slightly, having previously flexed their muscles in the title race and they will consider this game as one in which to get back on track. Aitor Karanka’s Middlesbrough do not give much away – particularly on their Premier League travels, where only Chelsea and Tottenham have conceded fewer goals. But Mauricio Pochettino’s team have come to look imposing at home and they back themselves to cut loose against anyone. David Hytner"
462,Crystal Palace,Sunderland,Fri 3 Feb 2017 17.29 GMT,2016-17,"Having secured his first league win as the Crystal Palace manager at Bournemouth in midweek, Sam Allardyce will be desperate to repeat the trick against his former employers. Sunderland need the points even more, with four points between them and Premier League safety, despite the creditable home draw against Tottenham. Expect a nerve-shredding match at Selhurst Park for all. Ed Aarons"
463,Everton,Bournemouth,Fri 3 Feb 2017 17.22 GMT,2016-17,"Everton have crept up the table and are seventh, having last been defeated on 19 December. The same cannot be said about Bournemouth who looked poor against Crystal Palace in midweek and are drifting towards the relegation zone. To make matters worse they are without Callum Wilson, who ruptured his anterior cruciate ligament in training. Dan Brown"
464,Hull City,Liverpool,Fri 3 Feb 2017 17.11 GMT,2016-17,"There was no evidence of transfer upheaval or lack of confidence impacting on Hull when they climbed off the bottom of the Premier League with a draw at Manchester United in midweek. A repeat performance, particularly in defence, will be in order when Liverpool visit with the aim of putting their January slump behind them. Sadio Mané, Philippe Coutinho and Adam Lallana all scored in the 5-1 defeat of Hull at Anfield in September and Jürgen Klopp finally has a full range of attacking options at his disposal again. Andy Hunter"
465,Chelsea,Arsenal,Fri 3 Feb 2017 16.56 GMT,2016-17,"Antonio Conte was keen to preach caution, insisting “if someone thinks the league is finished, I’m not so sure”, but Arsenal surely know their title pursuit is dependent on winning at Stamford Bridge. That damaging defeat to Watford has left Arsène Wenger’s side forlorn. They are hampered too by Chelsea’s eagerness to avenge that humiliation endured at the Emirates in September. They have been virtually untouchable ever since. Dominic Fifield"
466,Manchester City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 20 Jan 2017 18.19 GMT,2016-17,"Pep Guardiola has already conceded the Premier League title race and what might he say if Manchester City go down to Tottenham Hotspur at their own ground about hopes of Champions League qualification? They would not be out of it, of course, but it would add to the questions hovering over Guardiola’s side. Only an impressive defeat of Spurs might answer them but given the visitors’ form this seems unlikely. Jamie Jackson"
467,Stoke City,Manchester United,Fri 20 Jan 2017 17.54 GMT,2016-17,"For a team that failed to win in their first nine league games of the campaign, Stoke have staged a great recovery to sit in ninth place after 21 matches. Manchester United will offer a stern test for Mark Hughes’s side and although the visitors’ run of nine straight wins in all competitions was ended by last week’s draw with Liverpool, they are still favourites to avenge the 2-0 defeat they suffered here in December 2015. Rich Flower"
468,Arsenal,Burnley,Fri 20 Jan 2017 17.16 GMT,2016-17,Arsenal welcome back Hector Bellerín for Burnley’s visit to the Emirates as Arsène Wenger’s number of injured players dwindles. The Frenchman will be delighted by the prospect of having many more options at his disposal. Sean Dyche’s side have taken one point away from home this season in nine matches and have conceded 20 goals. Alexis Sánchez has all the motivation he needs. Graham Searles
469,Liverpool,Swansea City,Fri 20 Jan 2017 16.42 GMT,2016-17,"Liverpool have not lost a league game at Anfield in over a year and maintaining their impressive home form will be key to fulfilling dreams of the title. Jürgen Klopp’s side have scored 26 goals in nine home league games and host a Swansea side that have kept only one clean sheet in 13 games. New recruits Martin Olsson and Tom Carroll could debut for Paul Clement’s visitors but a third, Dutch winger Luciano Narsingh, is doubtful with a calf injury. Andy Hunter"
470,West Bromwich Albion,Sunderland,Fri 20 Jan 2017 16.16 GMT,2016-17,"Sunderland, hit more than most by Africa Cup of Nations call-ups, hope to arrest a run of four winless matches against topsy-turvy West Bromwich Albion. Yet despite last Saturday’s dismantling by Spurs the hosts are worthy of a top eight place and buoyed by a versatile signing in Jake Livermore. Jermain Defoe will hope Gareth McAuley retains jitters from White Hart Lane. Stuart Goodwin"
471,Bournemouth,Watford,Fri 20 Jan 2017 16.02 GMT,2016-17,"Bournemouth’s preoccupation with the number three will concern Eddie Howe, having conceded that many in five of their last six games. Yet during that run they also scored three in routing Swansea and drawing at home to Arsenal. The visitors have injuries and absences and are skirting with trouble, winless in the league since 10 December and with only two goals in six games. Stuart Goodwin"
472,Crystal Palace,Everton,Fri 20 Jan 2017 15.47 GMT,2016-17,"Any optimistic Crystal Palace supporters buoyed by a rare midweek win in the FA Cup will be wary that a dreadlocked Andy Preece scored Crystal Palace’s last winner against Everton at Selhurst Park, and that was almost 23 years ago. The current side have not even managed a goal when welcoming these opponents in this latest four-year stint in the top flight, which makes this fixture a daunting prospect. Sam Allardyce would have liked more additions than just Jeffrey Schlupp to throw in for a home debut. These are troubling times. Dominic Fifield"
473,Chelsea,Hull City,Fri 20 Jan 2017 15.33 GMT,2016-17,"Antonio Conte has time yet to determine whether Diego Costa has proved himself enough in training this week to start against Hull City, but he will resist the striker’s availability becoming a distraction. Chelsea play last of the title contenders and will be hoping to extend their lead at the top this weekend. “But our challenge is to keep the right concentration,” said the Italian. “If you think this game is easy, you make a great mistake and you can pay for this mistake at the end of the season.” He will be wary of ‘new coach bounce’. Dominic Fifield"
474,Southampton,Leicester City,Fri 20 Jan 2017 14.56 GMT,2016-17,"Southampton dominated proceedings against Leicester when these sides met in October but had to settle for a 0-0 draw because of poor finishing, a recurring problem this season. Claudio Ranieri’s side need to do better this time in order to hoist themselves further clear of the relegation zone and they may be helped by Southampton preparing for their EFL Cup semi-final second leg against Liverpool on Wednesday. Paul Doyle"
475,Middlesbrough,West Ham United,Fri 20 Jan 2017 14.08 GMT,2016-17,"Aitor Karanka has warned his defence about the threat posed by Andy Carroll. “He’s an amazing player,” said Middlesbrough’s manager. “He’s a player we have to be careful of. We need to try to stop him, to stop the balls to him.” Expert at securing goalless draws, Boro are only four points above the relegation zone and have scored just 17 times in 21 league games. Patrick Bamford, newly signed from Chelsea for £6m, hopes to improve such statistics but will begin on the bench. Louise Taylor"
476,Burnley,Southampton,Fri 13 Jan 2017 18.17 GMT,2016-17,"Only Chelsea and Tottenham have won more league games at home this season than Burnley so Southampton face a tall order at Turf Moor, especially as Claude Puel’s side are still struggling in front of goal. Former Burnley player Jay Rodriguez will be hoping to put that right to end a miserable run of three consecutive league defeats. Graham Searles"
477,Manchester United,Liverpool,Fri 13 Jan 2017 17.43 GMT,2016-17,"Manchester United’s morale is high but they started the weekend 10 points behind Chelsea, so José Mourinho’s men need to win to have a chance of taking the title. Jürgen Klopp’s second-placed Liverpool can lose and still be in the race but a resounding defeat would be damaging for their confidence. Jamie Jackson"
478,Everton,Manchester City,Fri 13 Jan 2017 17.22 GMT,2016-17,"Pep Guardiola’s last visit to Merseyside ended in defeat and recrimination at Anfield on New Year’s Eve, although that was the only game in the last six that Manchester City have failed to win. Guardiola’s side were on top form at West Ham United and Ronald Koeman said City could repeat that 5-0 FA Cup win should Everton reproduce the feeble defensive display that led to them being knocked out of the competition by Leicester City last weekend. New signings Morgan Schneiderlin and Ademola Lookman could feature for the hosts. Andy Hunter"
479,Sunderland,Stoke City,Fri 13 Jan 2017 17.10 GMT,2016-17,"Stoke have a poor record on Wearside but Mark Hughes will be hoping to return to winning ways after last week’s disappointing 2-0 home FA Cup defeat to Wolves. Already underwhelmed by what is turning into a slog of a league campaign, Stoke fans were seriously unhappy about that reverse and Hughes knows a correction is needed. Sunderland remain desperate to secure a win that seems near essential to sustaining David Moyes’s hopes of escaping relegation. Louise Taylor"
480,Swansea City,Arsenal,Fri 13 Jan 2017 16.51 GMT,2016-17,"If Arsenal are serious about hunting down Chelsea, then nothing less than victory will do at Swansea. While the good news for Arsenal is that Mesut Özil is back after illness, Hector Bellerín and Francis Coquelin are among a long list of absentees. Swansea have their own problems, with Neil Taylor and new signing Luciano Narsingh ruled out. Arsenal’s Olivier Giroud, who has scored in his past four matches, could be the man to watch. Stuart James"
481,Tottenham Hotspur,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 13 Jan 2017 16.32 GMT,2016-17,Mauricio Pochettino has Tottenham flying. They have six straight wins in all competitions and are playing the sort of football that took them close to the title last season. But West Brom are something of a bogey team and it was Tottenham’s failure to beat them at the end of last season that effectively derailed their title challenge. Pochettino knows that Albion will make life extremely difficult. David Hytner
482,Leicester City,Chelsea,Fri 13 Jan 2017 16.16 GMT,2016-17,"It was this fixture last season that spelt the end for José Mourinho at Chelsea as Leicester returned to top spot in a sign of things to come. Thirteen months on and the normal order has been restored as Leicester languish in the bottom half and Chelsea lead the way, yet Claudio Ranieri’s side have a chance to upset the apple cart. Jamie Vardy returns for Leicester after recovering from illness, with Nathan Aké set to replace the suspended John Terry in Chelsea’s squad. Stuart James"
483,Hull City,Bournemouth,Fri 13 Jan 2017 15.51 GMT,2016-17,"Marco Silva takes charge of his first Premier League match hoping for a miracle with his team bottom. Abel Hernández, last season’s top scorer, who has missed half of Hull’s league matches, is fit and the new arrival Oumar Niasse could also feature. Bournemouth will also have fresh legs, having rested their entire team for the embarrassing FA Cup defeat against Millwall. Simon Francis is suspended but Ryan Fraser has recovered from a calf injury. Paul MacInnes"
484,Watford,Middlesbrough,Fri 13 Jan 2017 15.35 GMT,2016-17,"The result will be of secondary importance to Watford after the death of Graham Taylor. They will, however, hope to arrest a slide that has secured only one point from five matches. The loan signing Tom Cleverley could start, while Heurelho Gomes and José Holebas return from illness. Middlesbrough will miss Gaston Ramírez but the £6m striker Rudy Gestede could make his debut. Paul MacInnes"
485,West Ham United,Crystal Palace,Fri 13 Jan 2017 14.37 GMT,2016-17,Sam Allardyce may fancy his chances of securing his first win as the Crystal Palace manager when he faces his old side. West Ham United have been rocked by Dimitri Payet’s request to leave and the France midfielder will be a notable absentee at the London Stadium. Palace are a point above the bottom three but they could drag Slaven Bilic’s inconsistent side back into the mire. Jacob Steinberg
486,Crystal Palace,Swansea City,Sun 1 Jan 2017 19.44 GMT,2016-17,"Guiding Swansea to a 5-4 win in November’s madcap reverse fixture did not make much of a difference for the then manager, Bob Bradley – he was sacked only five days after the losing side dispensed with the services of Alan Pardew. Defeat at Selhurst Park on Monday will not cost Sam Allardyce his job but it would put Palace in danger of slipping into the mire. Rich Flower"
487,Tottenham Hotspur,Chelsea,Sun 1 Jan 2017 19.35 GMT,2016-17,"Mauricio Pochettino has referenced his Tottenham side’s performance at Stamford Bridge on 26 November as a turning point of sorts in the season. They had been positive for the first 45 minutes and the manager felt that it showed they were over their Champions League exit. But they still lost, as everybody has done to Chelsea in the league over the past three months. Tottenham are in form and this could be wild. Can they stop the Chelsea juggernaut? David Hytner"
488,Bournemouth,Arsenal,Sun 1 Jan 2017 19.01 GMT,2016-17,"Bournemouth brushed aside Swansea City on New Year’s Eve and return to home soil hoping to close out a team at the opposite end of the table, Arsenal. Benik Afobe, in particular, will have been lifted by getting on the scoresheet at the Liberty Stadium before facing his former club. The on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, though, is ineligible to play against his parent club, with Arsène Wenger hopeful of a second win in three days. Ben Fisher"
489,Stoke City,Watford,Sun 1 Jan 2017 18.34 GMT,2016-17,"There has been little festive cheer for Stoke after the fixture computer handed them trips to Anfield and Stamford Bridge in between Christmas and new year and despite flattering to deceive before losing both games, the visit of Watford gives them a chance to end on a high. Sunday’s home humbling by Spurs was a fifth defeat in seven for Walter Mazzarri’s inconsistent side. Paul Chronnell"
490,West Bromwich Albion,Hull City,Sun 1 Jan 2017 17.55 GMT,2016-17,"Both these sides ended 2016 with encouraging results, although the fact West Bromwich managed to win 2-1 at Southampton but Hull were pegged back by Everton to draw 2-2 tells the story of their respective seasons. Tony Pulis’s side are riding high in eighth place and will look to consolidate that today, whereas Hull, in 19th, know they need to start winning soon if an instant return to the Championship is to be avoided. Paul Chronnell"
491,Middlesbrough,Leicester City,Sun 1 Jan 2017 17.41 GMT,2016-17,"Claudio Ranieri will want to see Leicester City capitalise on their solid win over West Ham. The Italian should be especially keen because this is the last game for which Islam Slimani and Riyad Mahrez will be available before leaving for the Africa Cup of Nations. Middlesbrough’s scoring average of fewer than one goal a game will not worry their opponents, who need to improve in 2017. Graham Searles"
492,Everton,Southampton,Sun 1 Jan 2017 16.48 GMT,2016-17,"Ronald Koeman endured a miserable return to St Mary’s Stadium in November when his current side were outmanoeuvred and beaten by his old one but fatigue may work in Everton’s favour this time around. Ludicrously, Southampton are playing for the third time in six days and Claude Puel has admitted it will be a struggle to juggle his resources at Goodison Park. Tom Davies, sharp as a substitute at Hull City on Friday, may get a chance to start in Everton’s midfield, with Koeman keen to protect Gareth Barry from two games in quick succession. Andy Hunter"
493,West Ham United,Manchester United,Sun 1 Jan 2017 15.50 GMT,2016-17,"Manchester United head to the London Stadium after five straight victories and unbeaten in their last 12 matches. How José Mourinho would love to continue 2017 in a similar vein with a sixth. However, he will be without Eric Bailly, who has joined up with his Ivory Coast team-mates before the Africa Cup of Nations while Michael Carrick and Wayne Rooney are both doubts. West Ham, who lost at Leicester City on Saturday, may be without the captain Mark Noble. Ben Fisher"
494,Manchester City,Burnley,Sun 1 Jan 2017 15.37 GMT,2016-17,"The pass-and-move masters that were Manchester City in their 10 consecutive wins at the start of the season now seem a mirage. The most troubling element of Saturday’s 1-0 defeat at Liverpool was that it was no surprise. Pep Guardiola’s side have been misfiring for a while despite the three wins on the bounce beforehand. Can Burnley turn them over at the Etihad? Sean Dyche’s side are 11th and have won their past two games, so this is another test for City. Jamie Jackson"
495,Sunderland,Liverpool,Sun 1 Jan 2017 15.23 GMT,2016-17,"Liverpool have won their past four matches, the most recent of which was against Manchester City. Sunderland are in poor form and lost 4-1 at Burnley last time out. There should, then, be only one winner. But with the visitors having less than 44 hours to prepare for this game and possibly lacking Jordan Henderson through injury, the hosts may sense they can cause an upset. Sachin Nakrani"
496,Watford,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 30 Dec 2016 18.34 GMT,2016-17,Watford have chanced upon an ideal time to play Tottenham. Jan Vertonghen and Kyle Walker are suspended and Toby Alderweireld may still be feeling the after-effects of a virus. However in Watford’s past six matches they have failed to score three times and scored more than one goal just once in the other three. Tottenham’s replacements will not be quaking in their boots. Graham Searles
497,Arsenal,Crystal Palace,Fri 30 Dec 2016 18.08 GMT,2016-17,"There has never been any love lost between Arsène Wenger and Sam Allardyce, despite the passing of the years bringing an entente of sorts, and both will be desperate for a positive result. For Wenger and Arsenal victory is essential, given Chelsea’s cushion at the top. Wenger describes them as “super-favourites” for the title. But what a tonic one point or more would be for Allardyce, as he gets his feet under the table at Palace. David Hytner"
498,Manchester United,Middlesbrough,Fri 30 Dec 2016 17.17 GMT,2016-17,"If Manchester United beat Middlesbrough this will be a fifth successive Premier League win for José Mourinho’s in-form side. Two seasons have passed since United last did the same number. In the sole golden run under Louis van Gaal, the February-April period of the 2014-15 season, United won six consecutive league games and offered an outside chance of the title before defeat at Chelsea, the eventual champions. The manager of the west Londoners then? Mourinho. Jamie Jackson"
499,Liverpool,Manchester City,Fri 30 Dec 2016 16.57 GMT,2016-17,"Undoubtedly the Christmas cracker of a festive program lacking in high-profile encounters. Liverpool and Manchester City do battle for second place. Both sides are so evenly matched, explosive in attack and liable to blunders at the back, that a coin toss might be the most effective way of choosing the victor. Sergio Agüero may disagree, the Argentinian will be eager to test the frequently error-prone Simon Mignolet with a thunderbolt or two. Graham Searles"
500,Burnley,Sunderland,Fri 30 Dec 2016 16.18 GMT,2016-17,"Burnley have won four of their past five home games and, if victorious against Sunderland, could end the year in the top half of the table. The absence of Jordan Pickford, Sunderland’s breakout star of 2016, may help them as Vito Mannone could be rusty after not featuring since 21 August. David Moyes and Sunderland, however, are no strangers to adversity and will be fired up by the possibility of climbing out of the relegation zone. Graham Searles"
501,Swansea City,Bournemouth,Fri 30 Dec 2016 15.42 GMT,2016-17,"There was only one good thing to say about the Bob Bradley experiment: when the end came, it was swift. However, the hope that things on the pitch will change for Swansea is hampered by the fact Alan Curtis, the caretaker manager, does not have much to choose from beyond the players who lost so pitifully against West Ham on Boxing Day. Bournemouth will hope to profit. Conrad Leach"
502,Southampton,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 30 Dec 2016 15.36 GMT,2016-17,This match – along with Southampton’s duel with Everton on 2 January – will have a bearing on which side collects the notional ‘best of the rest’ award at the end of the season for finishing just below the Premier League title-chasers. Southampton are likely to have most of the ball against West Brom but Claude Puel’s side are still struggling to find sharpness so the well organised visitors will fancy their chances of pinching a win. Paul Doyle
503,Leicester City,West Ham United,Fri 30 Dec 2016 15.26 GMT,2016-17,"West Ham arrive with nine points from nine while Leicester are looking to finish off the year in which they won the title with a win to stay out of the bottom three. “Considering where they were four seasons ago, it’s quite a normal situation for them,” said Slaven Bilic. To that end, City are helped by the returns from suspension of Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs. Mark Tallentire"
504,Chelsea,Stoke City,Fri 30 Dec 2016 15.10 GMT,2016-17,"Antonio Conte was dismissive of Arsène Wenger’s suggestion that the title is already Chelsea’s to lose, but will face Stoke seeking a 13th successive league win and conscious that his team are favourites. “I’m pleased if people are changing their opinions (of us),” he said. “But that means you must pay even more attention.” Standards must not slip here. Stoke drew at Stamford Bridge and twice triumphed at home against the Londoners last term. They represent distinctly awkward opposition. Dominic Fifield"
505,Chelsea,Bournemouth,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,"Antonio Conte must decide whether Michy Batshuayi is ready to start his first Premier League game in place of the suspended Diego Costa, with Cesc Fàbregas drafted into midfield, or if he must juggle his attacking resources to secure a club record 12th successive victory. The Italian will be aware that Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth won in south-west London last season, albeit while José Mourinho’s tenure was unravelling, and they will be awkward opponents. This will provide a test of sorts of the depth of Chelsea’s squad ahead of the transfer window. Dominic Fifield"
506,Liverpool,Stoke City,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,The stoppage time win at Everton felt like a defining three points for Jürgen Klopp’s team but they need to maintain pressure on Chelsea over the festive period to confirm as much. Liverpool have never lost a top-flight league game at home to Stoke – a sequence stretching back 53 games – although Mark Hughes’s team were the last to win at Anfield in the League Cup back in January. Joe Allen leads a strong ex-Liverpool contingent back at their old club. Andy Hunter
507,Leicester City,Everton,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,"Leicester City will have resented the nine-day wait to face Everton after their superb 10-man comeback against Stoke. Claudio Ranieri needs his side to pick up from where they left off to earn three points that would ensure not falling into the relegation zone before the new year. However the ill discipline of Jamie Vardy, Robert Huth and Christian Fuchs could cost them against an Everton side in the mood to avenge their excruciating derby defeat. Graham Searles"
508,Burnley,Middlesbrough,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,"This may be a defining period for Burnley, who have lost five in six but tend to let opponents know they have been in a game. Back-to-back wins over Middlesbrough and Sunderland cannot be discounted given their impressive home form, and might also help Sean Dyche attract the right January reinforcements. Their first festive test sees a rematch with last season’s Championship rivals Boro, with whom they shared a draw at Turf Moor in April. Aitor Karanka’s side, who cut loose all of a sudden in overwhelming Swansea, would consider a repeat of that a reasonable enough return this time too. Nick Ames"
509,Arsenal,West Bromwich Albion,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,"Arsenal’s slide from top to fourth in the space of eight days has led to familiar questions and, with them nine points off the pace, the prediction their title hopes are over. The Law of Wenger dictates they will bounce back against a West Bromwich Albion team who, apart from their tired showing against Manchester United last Saturday, have been in resurgent form. The alternative is a whole lot of wailing. David Hytner"
510,Swansea City,West Ham United,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,"West Ham can record a third successive victory for the first time this season against Swansea and Slaven Bilic will be confident his side can prevail. If other results go their way Bilic’s side could climb into the top half of the Premier League table. However, Bob Bradley will have watched the footage from West Ham’s past two wins and will see a side that is beatable, despite Swansea’s lowly standing – fans voted for the post to be man of the match at the London Stadium against Hull after it saved the home side three times. Graham Searles"
511,Southampton,Tottenham Hotspur,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,A punishing schedule of three matches in six days would suggest Southampton have somehow got themselves on the Premier League fixture computer’s naughty list this year. Claude Puel’s side will benefit from the 10-day break since their 3-1 win at Bournemouth but they risk losing the momentum generated by that impressive performance just as they head into a crucial run of fixtures. Rich Flower
512,Manchester United,Sunderland,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,Given the season it would be heartening to witness David Moyes receive a warm reception from Manchester United fans on his first return to Old Trafford since his sacking two years ago. This is as far as goodwill can extend of course as on the field the supporters only wish to see Sunderland beaten to make it four consecutive Premier League victories for José Mourinho’s side. Jamie Jackson
513,Hull City,Manchester City,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,"Manchester City may have one eye on their New Year’s Eve fixture against Liverpool when they arrive in Hull. And who can blame them? Without being disrespectful, Mike Phelan’s side should offer the chance for Pep Guardiola to test tactics and prepare for Sergio Agüero’s return at Anfield. Bottom-club Hull will be hoping for a Christmas miracle in order to salvage a result. Graham Searles"
514,Watford,Crystal Palace,Sat 24 Dec 2016 15.00 GMT,2016-17,There could be worse places for Sam Allardyce to take charge of his first game as Crystal Palace manager – his new club have a remarkable record at Vicarage Road having won six times and lost only once in their past 10 league visits. Walter Mazzarri’s Christmas wish must surely be for Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo to find form – the pair have four league goals between them so far compared to 16 at this point last season. Rich Flower
515,West Bromwich Albion,Manchester United,Fri 16 Dec 2016 18.33 GMT,2016-17,"West Bromwich Albion are the surprise package of the Premier League this season. It may sound unbelievable but Tony Pulis, frequently maligned for negative tactics, has his side playing with attacking verve and as a result they have scored one more goal than Manchester United in the league leaving them one place behind the visitors in seventh. However José Mourinho is unlikely to be fearful and will have the utmost faith that his improving side can take the spoils. Graham Searles"
516,Tottenham Hotspur,Burnley,Fri 16 Dec 2016 18.13 GMT,2016-17,"Burnley arrive at White Hart Lane with one goal and one point from seven away matches and few people expecting them to improve their record against a Tottenham side that have recovered a little rhythm after the disappointment of their Champions League exit. But Burnley had their moments in defeat at West Ham United on Wednesday and they revel in confounding the doubters. As Sean Dyche almost said on Friday, aren’t they supposed to be down already? David Hytner"
517,Manchester City,Arsenal,Fri 16 Dec 2016 18.04 GMT,2016-17,"Pep Guardiola and Arsène Wenger: two managers whose pass-pass-attack ethos is about as identical as can be expected so this match should fascinate. A point and a position separates Manchester City from Arsenal, in fourth and third respectively. And as City have not beaten the visitors since a 6-3 walloping three years ago, a victory for them would be particularly satisfying. One outcome seems certain – this will not be a goalless draw. Jamie Jackson"
518,Bournemouth,Southampton,Fri 16 Dec 2016 17.57 GMT,2016-17,"This could not be better for Bournemouth, with local rivals Southampton in town, as Eddie Howe’s side go in search of consecutive wins for the first time this season. They are level on points but Claude Puel’s side sit narrowly ahead of Bournemouth on goal difference. This is only their 24th meeting and for now it remains low-key. “The more games we play against Southampton the more the rivalry will grow,” Howe said on Friday. “It’s something we’re looking forward to.” Ben Fisher"
519,Crystal Palace,Chelsea,Fri 16 Dec 2016 16.35 GMT,2016-17,"Chelsea, resplendent at the top, will fancy their chances of equalling their club record of 11 league wins in succession given Crystal Palace’s fraught campaign. The hosts have the joint worst home record in the division and are undermined by injuries, with Alan Pardew still a manager very much under pressure. It is doubtful a mooted fan protest will amount to much but there is local disquiet after a wretched league year, and a squad reduced to 13 fit senior outfield players will do well to contain the visitors. Dominic Fifield"
520,Middlesbrough,Swansea City,Fri 16 Dec 2016 16.22 GMT,2016-17,"With a tally of just 13 goals in 16 games, Middlesbrough are the Premier League’s lowest scorers and there will be reason for anxiety on Teesside should Aitor Karanka’s shot shy side struggle to break down Swansea’s generous defence. This latest relegation six pointer represents the start of a potentially season-defining run of, on paper at least, winnable games for Swansea whose next four fixtures pit Bob Bradley’s side against West Ham, Bournemouth, Crystal Palace and Hull. Louise Taylor"
521,Sunderland,Watford,Fri 16 Dec 2016 16.11 GMT,2016-17,"David Moyes could have done without Younes Kaboul’s summer-time switch to Watford and a defender who was integral in last season’s survival should probably brace himself for a somewhat frosty Wearside reception if he features. With Sunderland’s January transfer coffers bare, this season’s relegation fight will be all about making do and mending for Moyes whose attempt to lift his team out of the mire would be enhanced if they could start scoring from set pieces. The big problem is that Wahbi Khazri and Sebastian Larsson, his two dead-ball specialists, are merely substitutes these days. Louise Taylor"
522,West Ham United,Hull City,Fri 16 Dec 2016 15.54 GMT,2016-17,"West Ham United are feeling better after picking up four points from their past two games and the visit of Hull City offers them a chance to edge away from the bottom three. After beating Burnley on Wednesday, they will be confident of finally recording consecutive wins in the league at the London Stadium. Andy Carroll is set to start again for Slaven Bilic’s side, who could condemn Hull to spending Christmas at the bottom of the table. Jacob Steinberg"
523,Stoke City,Leicester City,Fri 16 Dec 2016 15.16 GMT,2016-17,"A point from their last two games has checked Stoke’s rise and they will be without Marko Arnautovic over most of the Christmas period after his red card in the draw with Southampton. They are, at least, well stocked in attack and Mame Biram Diouf or Wilfried Bony will come in. Leicester would just like consistency: they lost 1-0 at Bournemouth on Tuesday – some anticlimax after their heroics against Manchester City. Nick Ames"
524,Everton,Liverpool,Fri 16 Dec 2016 13.56 GMT,2016-17,"The rivals approach the 227th Merseyside derby with morale lifted by important victories in midweek while also anxious to avoid a defeat that would ruin Christmas for one half of the city. Everton, who will be without the suspended captain, Phil Jagielka, are unbeaten at home in the Premier League this season but have not won any of the last 12 derbies. For all the scrutiny on their defence, Liverpool have kept four clean sheets in their last six matches and Jürgen Klopp will hope Joël Matip recovers from an ankle injury for their first experience of Goodison Park. Andy Hunter"
525,Leicester City,Manchester City,Fri 9 Dec 2016 18.34 GMT,2016-17,"Manchester City have had an extra day to prepare for today’s late kick-off, after both sides’ underwhelming exploits in the Champions League. City struggled without Sergio Agüero and Fernandinho on Tuesday and the pair start their respective lengthy bans against the Premier league champions, who will look to put their mid-week 5-0 defeat to Porto behind them. Michael Butler"
526,Chelsea,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 9 Dec 2016 18.11 GMT,2016-17,"Antonio Conte counted Chelsea as “underdogs” when he arrived at Stamford Bridge over the summer but now has to contemplate life as a title contender. “It’s difficult to accept this,” he offered before Sunday’s visit of an in form West Bromwich Albion. “I suppose it’s normal when you are playing well and winning a lot of games, but we have to make sure we don’t lose our hunger.” The visitors, awkward opponents and pepped by their own recent burst of positive results, will test their hosts’ momentum but, after eight wins in a row, Chelsea can be unstoppable at times. Dominic Fifield"
527,Hull City,Crystal Palace,Fri 9 Dec 2016 18.00 GMT,2016-17,Crystal Palace arrive at Hull City following a morale-boosting 3-0 win against Southampton that ended their run of six straight defeats. No such respite for the hosts who have seen everything go downhill since their transfer embargo was lifted and they began signing players. Palace could do with another win but Hull are desperate with a tough run of fixtures coming up. Neither side are strong in defence but the visitors’ attack is significantly more threatening which could make for another tough afternoon for Mike Phelan. Jack Harry
528,Swansea City,Sunderland,Fri 9 Dec 2016 17.35 GMT,2016-17,Sunderland have hit their annual run of form six months ahead of schedule while Swansea sit at the foot of the table. It would be tempting to predict a role reversal narrative but considering Swansea’s thrashing at the hands of Tottenham last time out this seems unlikely. A win for Bob Bradley’s side will see them overtake the visitors but David Moyes must be targeting a fourth win in five. Jack Harry
529,Manchester United,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 9 Dec 2016 17.24 GMT,2016-17,The mood at Manchester United is one of frustration mixed with confidence that very soon everything will begin to click and performance will match result. Tottenham Hotspur are six points ahead of José Mourinho’s side in fifth place and given Mauricio Pochettino was of interest to United before hiring the Portuguese each man may have a little extra motivation to deliver three points. Jamie Jackson
530,Watford,Everton,Fri 9 Dec 2016 16.59 GMT,2016-17,"Watford have the chance to leapfrog Everton if they can turn around their blip in form. Ronald Koeman will hardly be confident he can foil Walter Mazzarri’s side. The visitors have won once in nine attempts since a run of four successive victories ended in September. To spark an upturn in fortunes Romelu Lukaku will have to start scoring more frequently, he has just one goal in his last six matches. Everton’s next top-scorer is Gareth Barry. Graham Searles"
531,Burnley,Bournemouth,Fri 9 Dec 2016 15.40 GMT,2016-17,"Burnley may come to be thankful of the small cushion their early-season form gave them. They have lost three games in a row for the first time this season and need to arrest the slump quickly; on the plus side they continue to impress at Turf Moor, running Manchester City mightily close two weeks ago, and Bournemouth will not inspire too much fear despite their remarkable comeback against Liverpool. Eddie Howe’s visitors could use that being the springboard for some consistency now, and victory should strengthen their position in the top half. Nick Ames"
532,Liverpool,West Ham United,Fri 9 Dec 2016 14.52 GMT,2016-17,"What Slaven Bilic would give to turn back the clock. Last season West Ham recorded a league double over Liverpool for the first time since 1963-64, knocking Jürgen Klopp’s side out of the FA Cup too for good measure, but they return to Anfield without a win in six matches, one point above the relegation zone and with their manager under pressure following a humiliating 5-1 home defeat by Arsenal last weekend. Bilic needs a reaction, but so does Klopp following Liverpool’s collapse at Bournemouth. There is plenty at stake. Andy Hunter"
533,Arsenal,Stoke City,Fri 9 Dec 2016 14.38 GMT,2016-17,"Arsène Wenger has long demonstrated his capacity to respond to a setback but how he and Arsenal have done so after the EFL Cup exit to Southampton. They have taken apart West Ham and Basel and are determined to maintain the pressure on the leaders, Chelsea. Stoke, though, are in confident mood, having tightened up at the back and taken an impressive 18 points from 27. Could they get something at Arsenal for the first time since 1981? David Hytner"
534,Southampton,Middlesbrough,Fri 9 Dec 2016 14.11 GMT,2016-17,"It has been an awful week for Southampton. A heavy defeat at Crystal Palace was followed by elimination from the Europa League and a serious injury to Charlie Austin, the only player who has scored regularly for the club this season. Middlesbrough have lost only one match away in the league this season and will feel confident of adding to Claude Puel’s woes. Paul Doyle"
535,Tottenham Hotspur,Swansea City,Fri 2 Dec 2016 17.40 GMT,2016-17,"Bob Bradley has finally generated the momentum he has craved and his head may still be spinning, in a good way, after last Saturday’s 5-4 win over Crystal Palace – his first in charge of Swansea. He comes to London with his team still in the relegation places but with renewed belief and ready to confront opponents who have lost some fluency over the past two months. For Tottenham, this feels like a must-win. David Hytner"
536,Middlesbrough,Hull City,Fri 2 Dec 2016 17.31 GMT,2016-17,"As encouraging as Middlesbrough’s recent performances have been they have still won only twice and are one point ahead of Hull. While Harry Maguire – a centre half coveted by Aitor Karanka – may have a chance to audition for a January move by marking Álvaro Negredo, the absence of Boro’s injured left-back George Friend could permit Robert Snodgrass to undermine the potentially vulnerable Fábio da Silva. Do not bet against Adama Traoré’s extraordinary pace and dribbling ability for Boro proving key though. Louise Taylor"
537,Manchester City,Chelsea,Fri 2 Dec 2016 16.45 GMT,2016-17,"An age seems to have passed since Manchester City hammered Chelsea 3-0 in the corresponding fixture last season that featured John Terry being hauled off at half-time and which came in the wake of José Mourinho’s dispute with club doctor, Eva Carneiro. While that defeat proved an omen of the demise of Mourinho and his champions, Chelsea arrive as leaders and a point better off than City, which means a draw would be a fine result for them. Expect both teams, though, to go for what would be a statement victory. Jamie Jackson"
538,West Ham United,Arsenal,Fri 2 Dec 2016 16.24 GMT,2016-17,"Both of these sides suffered midweek defeats in the EFL Cup but Arsenal will be confident of maintaining their title challenge. News that Santi Cazorla requires surgery on an ankle injury is a blow but Arsène Wenger’s side have not lost in the league since the opening day, while West Ham are a point above the bottom three. Although Andy Carroll is available, Aaron Cresswell and Michail Antonio are out. Jacob Steinberg"
539,Everton,Manchester United,Fri 2 Dec 2016 15.37 GMT,2016-17,"Form hardly indicates a quality affair at Goodison Park – the hosts have won once in eight league games, the visitors once in seven – but at least José Mourinho can draw confidence from a United team who are gradually clicking into shape and showed they do know where the goal is located in the midweek EFL Cup victory over West Ham. Ronald Koeman, in contrast, appears to be losing belief in the talent at his disposal by the week but insists “a lot of things can change on Sunday”. Andy Hunter"
540,West Bromwich Albion,Watford,Fri 2 Dec 2016 15.17 GMT,2016-17,"Tony Pulis goes into the game £3.8m poorer having lost his case against Crystal Palace but focused on a first top-half finish with West Brom now ninth. He may have to cope without Salomón Rondón, sent home with tonsilitis, as Watford, a place higher and enjoying their best start since the mid-80s, seek more reward and with Troy Deeney after his 100th club goal. Mark Tallentire"
541,Crystal Palace,Southampton,Fri 2 Dec 2016 14.33 GMT,2016-17,"The writing is on the wall for Alan Pardew. Crystal Palace go into this game on the back of six successive defeats, a run that has taken them to the brink of the relegation zone, with concerned owners considering the merits of Sam Allardyce, Chris Coleman, Roberto Mancini and Roy Hodgson as alternatives. Only victory will do but Southampton arrive buoyed by a fine display at Arsenal that has earned them a first League Cup semi-final in 30 years. Two years ago, their win at Selhurst Park cost Neil Warnock his job at Palace. History may be repeating itself. Dominic Fifield"
542,Stoke City,Burnley,Fri 2 Dec 2016 13.01 GMT,2016-17,"Stoke are now much closer to where they had expected to be and, although the injury list remains long, Mark Hughes has some welcome posers. Will he stick with the back three he selected against Watford, who were so successful last week? Will Joe Allen, in such fine form before suspension, come back into a side who dominated at Vicarage Road with a big contribution from the midfielder’s replacement, Giannelli Imbula? Sean Dyche will hope Hughes is blinded by his options: Burnley could do with something here after two consecutive defeats. Nick Ames"
543,Bournemouth,Liverpool,Fri 2 Dec 2016 12.18 GMT,2016-17,"Bournemouth face the unenviable task of a visit from high-flying Liverpool. Jürgen Klopp’s side are in dominant form, manifested in a 15-match unbeaten run in all competitions that the German will expect to be extended. However, without Philippe Coutinho to terrorise his defenders, Eddie Howe can find some solace. The focus for Bournemouth will be finding attacking flair of their own after scoring just three goals in five matches, since putting six past Hull in October. Graham Searles"
544,Watford,Stoke City,Fri 25 Nov 2016 18.34 GMT,2016-17,"Stoke City arrive at Vicarage Road after a frustrating home defeat to Bournemouth. If Mark Hughes wants a strong reaction he can take inspiration from Watford who responded to a humiliating defeat at Liverpool by tearing into Leicester last week, going 2-0 up after 12 minutes. Walter Mazzarri reshaped his side for that match and Odion Ighalo looks likely to stay on the bench, such was the quality of Roberto Pereyra’s showing with Troy Deeney. Joe Allen is suspended for Stoke, while his midfield partner Glenn Whelan is doubtful with a calf problem. Paul MacInnes"
545,Manchester United,West Ham United,Fri 25 Nov 2016 18.20 GMT,2016-17,"Manchester United are struggling to string a run of wins together since the three claimed at the start of the campaign. Given the close nature of the title race, a repeat of this could move José Mourinho’s side into the upper echelons. For West Ham even a single victory would be welcome: their last in the Premier League was over a month ago, when Sunderland were beaten 1-0 on 22 October. Jamie Jackson"
546,Hull City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 25 Nov 2016 18.02 GMT,2016-17,"Hull’s failings, particularly in front of goal, were exposed by Sunderland last week and they remain hampered by injuries and beset by supporter unrest. They may have Andrew Robertson and Adama Diomandé back to face a West Brom side who were themselves the subject of grumbling from fans earlier in the season, but are in fine fettle after impressive wins over Leicester City and Burnley. Tom Davies"
547,Burnley,Manchester City,Fri 25 Nov 2016 17.49 GMT,2016-17,"Sean Dyche says Manchester City are in a “different world” to Burnley, but will want a reaction from his side after they made West Brom look extraterrestrial on Monday. Their 4-0 defeat continued some poor away form but at Turf Moor things are rather different and, having beaten Liverpool and Everton there as well as losing unfairly to Arsenal, they should make a fight of this one. Pep Guardiola may be considering Wednesday’s night Champions League away trip was not to have not been the best preparation for a Saturday lunchtime game against opponents who will not stop running. Nick Ames"
548,Arsenal,Bournemouth,Fri 25 Nov 2016 17.16 GMT,2016-17,"Arsenal have once again stuttered in November as Arsène Wenger’s side have slipped from joint-top of the league in October to fourth. Victory is imperative against Bournemouth to produce a much-needed shot in the arm heading into the congested Christmas period. Eddie Howe will be the much more relaxed of the two managers, his side have exceeded expectation this season and, in only their third league meeting with Arsenal, would love to add to Wenger’s traditional autumnal woes. Graham Searles"
549,Liverpool,Sunderland,Fri 25 Nov 2016 16.20 GMT,2016-17,"Jürgen Klopp’s belief in staying grounded is well established but he was surely taking it too far when he proclaimed Sunderland favourites on account of their six points from the last two games compared to Liverpool’s four. “They are in their best moment of the season,” he added, and while that argument is not in dispute David Moyes, Victor Anichebe and other ex-Evertonians in the Sunderland ranks will have to excel to stifle a Liverpool side that have scored 17 goals in five home games. That equals Liverpool’s most prolific output since scoring 19 in five in 1980-81. Andy Hunter"
550,Leicester City,Middlesbrough,Fri 25 Nov 2016 16.03 GMT,2016-17,"With their place in the Champions League knockout stage secured, Leicester need to turn around their alarming domestic form to put to bed any more questions about relegation. Danny Drinkwater will be suspended for the visit of Middlesbrough, giving Andy King an opportunity to make a rare start. One point and one place behind Leicester, Aitor Karanka’s side also need the points and could do with a goal from Álvaro Negredo, who has not scored since the opening day of the season. Stuart James"
551,Swansea City,Crystal Palace,Fri 25 Nov 2016 15.43 GMT,2016-17,"A huge game for both clubs. Swansea are rock bottom of the table and without a victory since the opening day of the season. Crystal Palace, on the other hand, have lost their last five and travel to the Liberty Stadium with Alan Pardew, their manager, under growing pressure. Bob Bradley seems likely to stick with the same side that drew at Everton, so Gylfi Sigurdsson will play as a false No9. Joe Ledley could come back into contention for Palace. Stuart James"
552,Southampton,Everton,Fri 25 Nov 2016 14.55 GMT,2016-17,"A heavy defeat at Chelsea followed by a frustrating home draw with Swansea City means Ronald Koeman could do with a win on his return to St Mary’s with Everton. His successor at Southampton, Claude Puel, will hope that his team overcome their profligate streak. They need to start scoring more, as bad finishing jeopardised their Europa League campaign in mid-week and has cost them a lot of points in the Premier League this season. Paul Doyle"
553,Chelsea,Tottenham,Fri 25 Nov 2016 14.31 GMT,2016-17,"Tottenham Hotspur will hardly be relishing their latest attempt to secure a first top-flight win at Stamford Bridge since 1990. Spurs are still coming to terms with their midweek defeat in Monaco which has cast them from the Champions League, with their unbeaten league record now under threat against the revitalised leaders. Antonio Conte’s side have been untouchable over recent weeks, a three-man defence yet to be breached after 590 minutes and the forward line back to its rampaging best. An awkward evening awaits the visitors. Dominic Fifield"
554,Middlesbrough,Chelsea,Fri 18 Nov 2016 18.37 GMT,2016-17,"Aitor Karanka would relish celebrating his third anniversary of taking charge at The Riverside with a win. If Middlesbrough’s recent draws at Arsenal and Manchester City should make title chasing Chelsea suitably wary, they are likely to have to contend with the fit again Diego Costa and Eden Hazard. Ben Gibson’s duel with Costa promises to be an intriguing sub-plot as the visitors seek to emphasise their rebirth under Antonio Conte whose tactical joust with Karanka could be fascinating. Louise Taylor"
555,Sunderland,Hull City,Fri 18 Nov 2016 18.22 GMT,2016-17,"When David Moyes succeeded Sir Alex Ferguson as Manchester United manager he chose to ignore Ferguson’s advice and opted against retaining the services of Mike Phelan as assistant at Old Trafford. Hull’s manager may have forgiven his Sunderland counterpart but he almost certainly has not forgotten as their teams prepare for a game which surely offers a near perfect definition of the term “relegation six pointer”. With Will Keane out for the season and Abel Hernández injured, Hull lack attacking firepower and will be more dependent on Robert Snodgrass than ever. Louise Taylor"
556,Watford,Leicester City,Fri 18 Nov 2016 17.43 GMT,2016-17,"Having been beaten at home by West Brom last time out Leicester will be looking to make amends on Saturday. Unfortunately for Claudio Ranieri’s side they face Watford, a team not only six places above them in the table but one looking to avenge their own humbling 6-1 defeat at the hands of Liverpool. Watford’s Walter Mazzarri insists his side should be “angry” but he will also be relieved that Heurelho Gomes has recovered quickly from a knee injury. Leicester, meanwhile, are still without Kasper Schmeichel, while Danny Drinkwater is 50/50 with a rib injury. Paul MacInnes"
557,Manchester United,Arsenal,Fri 18 Nov 2016 17.16 GMT,2016-17,"The fixture that brought us “the battle of the buffet”, Manchester United’s 8-2 win, and Arsène Wenger being sent to the Old Trafford stands (to name but a few memorable occasions) has gone a little quiet recently. José Mourinho and Wenger are hardly bosom buddies and United are desperate for the win to cut the deficit to Arsenal to three points, so maybe sparks will fly again. Jamie Jackson"
558,Everton,Swansea City,Fri 18 Nov 2016 16.49 GMT,2016-17,"Bob Bradley has lamented the lack of leaders at Swansea, who are winless in their last 10 games, and it may deepen the sense of regret to see Ashley Williams in the opposition defence at Goodison Park. The Wales international faces his former club for the first time since his £12m move to Everton, who are also under pressure to react following a 5-0 mauling at Chelsea before the international break that manager Ronald Koeman described as “unacceptable in every aspect of football”. Andy Hunter"
559,Crystal Palace,Manchester City,Fri 18 Nov 2016 16.36 GMT,2016-17,"Manchester City will hardly confront this game with much trepidation given Crystal Palace endured a miserable and pointless four-game streak between the autumn international breaks. The hosts are further hampered by the loss of Steve Mandanda to a knee injury but, while they are intent on resurgence, this will also be a sombre occasion. Tributes are to be paid to those who lost their lives in the Croydon tram derailment, with Palace and their players having made donations to the fund set up for the families involved. Dominic Fifield"
560,West Bromwich Albion,Burnley,Fri 18 Nov 2016 15.55 GMT,2016-17,"Tony Pulis will have been disappointed the international break came just after West Bromwich ended their five-match winless run with three points at Leicester. However, Salomon Rondón’s return from injury should keep spirits high. Sean Dyche must share his counterpart’s sentiments but will be confident momentum lies with Burnley. An away victory might seem like child’s play to him compared to shutting out Manchester United at Old Trafford. Graham Searles"
561,Stoke City,Bournemouth,Fri 18 Nov 2016 15.07 GMT,2016-17,"Six games unbeaten have dispersed the cloud over Stoke caused by a slow start. Their revival coincided with the return of key players to fitness but there are several doubts for Bournemouth’s visit, although Xherdan Shaqiri and Marko Arnautovic return and it would take a brave punter to back an away win. Bournemouth have taken two points on the road and another slim return would drag them nearer to the relegation places. Eddie Howe believes they will soon be rewarded for the number of chances they are creating. Nick Ames"
562,Tottenham Hotspur,West Ham United,Fri 18 Nov 2016 14.29 GMT,2016-17,"Slaven Bilic was on the winning side when he made his West Ham debut in this fixture in 1996 and the manager is equally optimistic as they prepare to face England’s unbeaten team, albeit one who last won on 2 September, before the previous international break. “They are solid, they are electric,” Bilic said, “but we have improved and if we play good, we have a chance.” Mark Tallentire"
563,Southampton,Liverpool,Fri 18 Nov 2016 12.54 GMT,2016-17,"Claude Puel has said he will not try to curb his team’s attacking intent in an effort to stifle the league leaders but he may have to adjust his team because of injuries. An array of players face late fitness tests before the game. That is far from ideal for the Frenchman, whose team already betrayed signs of wear and tear in their last game before the international break, a defeat at Hull. Yet Liverpool, who also have fitness worries, will know they will need to be close to their best to get the win that will ensure they remain top of the table. Paul Doyle"
564,Hull City,Southampton,Fri 4 Nov 2016 18.33 GMT,2016-17,"Southampton could not hope for better opposition in Hull City, to ease tired legs, after taking revenge against Internazionale on Thursday night. Mike Phelan’s side have lost six successive league games and a good run in the EFL Cup is unlikely to lift spirits. However Phelan could be thrown a lifeline if Robert Snodgrass returns from injury, the Scot was instrumental in Hull’s early season triumphs. Graham Searles"
565,Manchester City,Middlesbrough,Fri 4 Nov 2016 18.14 GMT,2016-17,"After Manchester City’s fine win over Barcelona, Middlesbrough may not relish a visit to an Etihad Stadium that is sure to be in good spirits as a result. Pep Guardiola’s side now appear over the hump of six games with no wins – a sequence that did not affect their status as leaders. Aitor Karanka’s side are a respectable 15th, three points above the drop zone. But it would represent a shock and setback for City should they lose on Saturday. Jamie Jackson"
566,Arsenal,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 4 Nov 2016 17.56 GMT,2016-17,Mauricio Pochettino has to hope that the adage about form going out of the window on derby days rings true. Tottenham might be unbeaten in the Premier League but they have hit something of a wall in creative terms while Arsenal have goals in them and their tails up. Arsène Wenger has injury doubts over a clutch of players but he has selection headaches in a good way. The return of Harry Kane is a prominent sub-plot. David Hytner
567,Swansea City,Manchester United,Fri 4 Nov 2016 16.41 GMT,2016-17,"Another away game for Manchester United and a chance for José Mourinho’s players to respond to the manager’s scathing criticism of their efforts against Fenerbahce. Swansea, on the face of it, should be benign opponents. They are second from bottom, without a victory since the opening day and have collected only two points from a possible 27, prompting Bob Bradley to describe keeping Swansea up as a “huge” job. Mourinho must feel the same way about turning United around. Stuart James"
568,Liverpool,Watford,Fri 4 Nov 2016 16.00 GMT,2016-17,"Jürgen Klopp insists Liverpool will respect a Watford side that have lost once on the road and kept three consecutive clean sheets, though he also knows his team have found solutions to most obstacles this season. The joint league leaders have not lost at Anfield since January and have won 12 and drawn three of their last 18 home matches; they are nine points better off than at the same stage last season. James Milner, Emre Can and Georginio Wijnaldum have all been ill this week but will be given until the last moment to recover. Andy Hunter"
569,West Ham United,Stoke City,Fri 4 Nov 2016 15.43 GMT,2016-17,"All eyes will be on security at the London Stadium after the problems during West Ham United’s victory over Chelsea. But Slaven Bilic’s side also have problems on the pitch. They are 17th and face a Stoke side unbeaten in their past five matches. Stoke have concerns in attack, though, with Marko Arnautovic suspended and Xherdan Shaqiri doubtful because of a hamstring problem. Jacob Steinberg"
570,Leicester City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 4 Nov 2016 15.29 GMT,2016-17,"Unbeaten in four matches in all competitions, Leicester are enjoying their best run of the season, yet are still some way short of their title-winning form. They will have to do without Kasper Schmeichel against West Brom after he fractured his hand against Copenhagen. Ron-Robert Zieler, Schmeichel’s deputy, can expect some sort of aerial assault against an Albion side without a win in five matches and reeling from last Saturday’s hammering at home to Manchester City. Stuart James"
571,Burnley,Crystal Palace,Fri 4 Nov 2016 15.13 GMT,2016-17,"Palace do little by halves but would not be too dissatisfied with a point at Turf Moor, arresting a recent slump that, allied with an upturn for Burnley, has brought the sides level on points. Sean Dyche’s defence rode out a storm at Old Trafford last week and have shown they will be intensely competitive. Their injury concerns are easing too and Dyche must decide whether to restore the fit-again Steven Defour to the midfield after a win and a draw in his absence. Nick Ames"
572,Chelsea,Everton,Fri 4 Nov 2016 14.47 GMT,2016-17,"Antonio Conte’s Chelsea have revived with four successive Premier League wins and clean sheets but must now confront a player they had hoped to re-sign when Romelu Lukaku returns with Everton. The fees being quoted for the Belgian over the summer had been mind-boggling. As it is, he stayed at Goodison Park and Diego Costa is thriving again at Stamford Bridge. “Diego is not only scoring the goals but working a lot for the team,” said Conte of the division’s leading scorer to date this term. “I’m seeing a complete player in Diego.” Theirs will be an intriguing tête-à-tête. Dominic Fifield"
573,Bournemouth,Sunderland,Fri 4 Nov 2016 13.08 GMT,2016-17,"David Moyes takes his Sunderland side to Bournemouth, in search of their first Premier League win of the season at the 11th time of asking. Sunderland were in the vicinity only last week, after flying back to the north-east from Bournemouth airport after a poor performance against Southampton in the EFL Cup. A much-needed win would provide Moyes at least some respite. Bournemouth, meanwhile, will hope home comforts can see them return to winning ways, after an indifferent performance in defeat by Middlesbrough last time out. Ben Fisher"
574,Tottenham Hotspur,Leicester City,Fri 28 Oct 2016 18.03 BST,2016-17,"There was talk towards the end of last season about how Tottenham were coming for Leicester. Claudio Ranieri’s side waited and they waited, before wrapping up the title in relatively comfortable style. Their 1-0 win in this fixture last January had been a crucial result – on a night when Mauricio Pochettino was as animated as he has been in the White Hart Lane dug-out. Tottenham, who have made their best start to a Premier League season, are after a measure of revenge. David Hytner"
575,Sunderland,Arsenal,Fri 28 Oct 2016 17.50 BST,2016-17,"With two points from their opening nine Premier League games, Sunderland have made the worst start to a top tier season since Sheffield Wednesday – (who had only one point at the same stage) – back in 1999-2000. Arsenal are probably the last team David Moyes would want to be facing as he strives to secure an elusive first league victory since succeeding Sam Allardyce in July but a crowd well in excess of 45,000 is expected to turn up to see him try. Its collective mood could prove influential. Louise Taylor"
576,Stoke City,Swansea City,Fri 28 Oct 2016 17.36 BST,2016-17,"Crisis, what crisis? You could not get great odds on Mark Hughes surviving the season after overseeing a limp 4-1 defeat at Crystal Palace in mid-September but Stoke, inspired by Joe Allen and Xherdan Shaqiri, have rallied since. A point at Old Trafford preceded comfortable wins against Sunderland and Hull; Stoke might well be expected to beat such opposition and the visit of Swansea seems similarly appetising. Victory for the visitors would be Bob Bradley’s first as manager, but what price Wilfried Bony will coming to the party and opening his account for Stoke against his old club? Nick Ames"
577,Manchester United,Burnley,Fri 28 Oct 2016 17.14 BST,2016-17,"Will the derby win over Manchester City be a turning point for José Mourinho and United? Perhaps, but anything less than a convincing win here would see the doom-merchants back out in force. Burnley may have recorded a couple of notable home scalps, against Liverpool and Everton, but they have struggled away from Turf Moor, conceding three in all three of their games on the road. Alan Smith"
578,Watford,Hull City,Fri 28 Oct 2016 16.40 BST,2016-17,"Daryl Janmaat could feature after overcoming a shoulder injury, as Watford try to maintain their positive start to the season. Hull are without a league win since August, and were dealt a huge blow with the loss of captain and top scorer Robert Snodgrass to an ankle injury in their 2-0 home defeat to Stoke. Mike Phelan has also lost striker Adama Diomandé, who was banned for violent conduct after Hull’s EFL Cup victory, Phelan’s first since becoming manager permanently, over Bristol City. Scott Brotherton"
579,Southampton,Chelsea,Fri 28 Oct 2016 16.08 BST,2016-17,"Claude Puel continues to rotate to good effect as Southampton show themselves to be both solid and enterprising despite regular changes. Chelsea will have to excel, much like they did last weekend against Manchester United, to extend their three-game winning streak in the league. A lot could depend on how well the visitors’ wing-backs do against Southampton’s full-backs. Paul Doyle"
580,Crystal Palace,Liverpool,Fri 28 Oct 2016 15.46 BST,2016-17,Liverpool’s ascent to the upper echelons of the Premier League table has seen them go seven games unbeaten and score 16 goals in the process but their trip to SE25 may not be so straightforward. Palace have a strong record against them at Selhurst Park despite defeat last season and have won four of the last seven league matches there. But Alan Pardew will be hoping Jason Puncheon is fit to play – Palace have yet to win a league match without him since he signed in 2013. Ed Aarons
581,West Bromwich Albion,Manchester City,Fri 28 Oct 2016 14.24 BST,2016-17,"Tony Pulis will toast signing what, not too long ago, appeared to be an unlikely contract extension by looking to get one over Pep Guardiola, who will be desperate to avoid extending an already record winless streak to seven. Fortunately for City they have won nine of their past meetings against West Brom. But can a team lacking a cutting edge break down a notoriously rigid defensive unit? Alan Smith"
582,Middlesbrough,Bournemouth,Fri 28 Oct 2016 13.20 BST,2016-17,"As his side seek their first home win since April, Aitor Karanka has a big decision to make. Does he keep faith with Adama Traoré, whose pace so unsettled Arsenal during last weekend’s 0-0 draw at the Emirates or recall the more tactically aware, positionally disciplined Stewart Downing? Perhaps he will find a way of accommodating both wingers while silencing those who suggested Aston Villa got the better deal when Traoré and Albert Adomah swapped clubs in August. Louise Taylor"
583,Everton,West Ham United,Fri 28 Oct 2016 12.18 BST,2016-17,"Ronald Koeman may have rectified the glaring weaknesses in Everton’s defending since replacing Roberto Martínez but the team continues to falter in the final third and has now gone five matches without a win. The early season confidence surrounding Everton has dispersed as a result and Slaven Bilic, by contrast, returns to Goodison Park in the belief West Ham’s season is improving following three consecutive victories. It might also be a relief to get away from the Olympic Stadium. Andy Hunter"
584,Swansea City,Watford,Fri 21 Oct 2016 19.48 BST,2016-17,"Swansea were the first side in the top flight to make a managerial change, dispensing with the services of Francesco Guidolin during the international break and appointing the experienced Bob Bradley in his place. There were plenty of encouraging signs for the American in his first game in charge, as his side narrowly lost to Arsenal. Watford have been exciting to watch going forward but look shaky in defence, while Etienne Capoue has been this season’s revelation, netting four goals in the opening eight games of the season. Alex Bowmer"
585,Manchester City,Southampton,Fri 21 Oct 2016 19.45 BST,2016-17,Pep Guardiola was eloquent and defiant in Friday’s pre-game press conference but the bottom line is if he follows Wednesday night’s 4-0 humiliation at Barcelona with a loss to Southampton he can expect a mini-inquiry into why his side have failed to win for five games. This might not be reasonable but in English football’s boom-and-bust culture it is just the way it is. Claude Puel’s side are unbeaten in the league since 10 September and up to eighth but it will still be a shock if the leaders are unable to defeat them. Jamie Jackson
586,Leicester City,Crystal Palace,Fri 21 Oct 2016 19.42 BST,2016-17,"Last season’s champions have made a below-par start to their title defence but their Champions League campaign is going serenely. Palace currently lie ninth, having been boosted in the transfer window by the arrival of Christian Benteke. The corresponding fixture last season was settled by a Jamie Vardy winner, as he scored for the seventh successive Premier League game on his way to breaking Ruud van Nistelrooy’s record of 10. Alex Bowmer"
587,Burnley,Everton,Fri 21 Oct 2016 19.35 BST,2016-17,"Burnley will be looking to replicate their 2-0 win over Liverpool when they come up against Everton. Despite an encouraging start to the season, it will be tough going against a Ronald Koeman’s side who seem rejuvenated following his appointment in the summer. The visitors are just two points off a Champions League place and boast one of the division’s form players in Romelu Lukaku. They have also won the past three league contests between the teams. Alex Bowmer"
588,Bournemouth,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 21 Oct 2016 19.31 BST,2016-17,"Bournemouth welcome Mauricio Pochettino’s side to a ground that has become something of a fortress recently. Eddie Howe’s team have recorded three consecutive home wins, although the size of the task ahead of them on Saturday needs no introduction. Bournemouth took the lead in the first minute but were humiliated 5-1 by Tottenham in this fixture last season, with Harry Kane scoring a hat-trick. Ben Fisher"
589,Arsenal,Middlesbrough,Fri 21 Oct 2016 19.26 BST,2016-17,What better present could Arsenal gift Arsène Wenger than three points and a seventh consecutive league win as he celebrates his 67th birthday on Saturday. Let alone the potential to claim top spot all for themselves. Meanwhile Middlesbrough are on a grim run of form having only won once from eight attempts. Aitor Karanka will have his work cut out to make his side believe they can stop Arsenal’s attacking force and spoil Wenger’s party. Graham Searles
590,Chelsea,Manchester United,Fri 21 Oct 2016 16.56 BST,2016-17,"The home support will bellow Matthew Harding’s name before kick-off in memory of the Chelsea vice-chairman, who died in a helicopter crash 20 years ago, though it will be José Mourinho who will be hogging the limelight. This is his first return to Stamford Bridge as manager of a rival Premier League club and many of those players who under-performed so badly last term will line up against his Manchester United side. “He deserves a good reception,” said Antonio Conte. “He is part of the story of this club.” Some of those on the pitch may have their own points to prove to the Portuguese. Dominic Fifield"
591,Hull City,Stoke City,Fri 21 Oct 2016 16.45 BST,2016-17,"Mike Phelan’s pleasure at having his captain, Michael Dawson, available for the first time this season will have been tempered by the loss of Andrew Robertson for eight weeks with a thigh injury in last week’s disastrous 6-1 thrashing by Bournemouth. A broken kneecap sustained by Moses Odubajo in training means the Hull City manager may switch to a back three to compensate for a lack of available full-backs as he seeks to shore up the top flight’s leakiest defence. Rich Flower"
592,Liverpool,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 21 Oct 2016 16.01 BST,2016-17,"With Liverpool’s sights raised this season Jürgen Klopp might not lead thechorus-line celebrations in front of the Kop should his team salvage a point in added time against Albion this time. “But everything is possible,” he admitted. The last three meetings between the teams have been drawn but, having defended Manchester United’s long balls on Monday, Klopp believes Liverpool are better equipped to deal with the Tony Pulis approach that caused him and his players such consternation last season. Adam Lallana is fit to start and improve the urgency and accuracy that was missing from Liverpool’s display against United. Andy Hunter"
593,West Ham United,Sunderland,Fri 21 Oct 2016 14.54 BST,2016-17,"Sunderland’s search for their first league win of the season takes them to the London Stadium. Given that West Ham have been uncomfortable in their new home, this is a good opportunity for David Moyes’s strugglers.

594,Stoke City,Sunderland,Fri 14 Oct 2016 18.44 BST,2016-17,"David Moyes has lost only three of his 17 league meetings with Mark Hughes but the Stoke manager considers this to be the first of seven winnable games, a reasonable return from which would improve the mood after failing to register one in their first seven. Sunderland, too, have yet to win and they occupy bottom spot, with the West Brom draw last time out representing an up-turn. Mark Tallentire"
595,Southampton,Burnley,Fri 14 Oct 2016 18.38 BST,2016-17,"Southampton face a test to sustain their fine form as they go into the first of seven matches in 22 days with important defensive injuries. Both of their first-choice full-backs will miss the visit of Burnley, who will be aiming to become the first team in seven matches to score against Southampton. Sean Dyche’s side have also been performing well lately and will fancy their chances of collecting their first away point of the campaign. Paul Doyle"
596,Middlesbrough,Watford,Fri 14 Oct 2016 17.48 BST,2016-17,"With only one League win this season – against Sunderland – Middlesbrough could do with registering a first victory at the Riverside since April. Six points from seven games is a slightly disappointing return for Aitor Karanka who needs more from the currently under-achieving Gaston Ramírez and can only hope Álvaro Negredo rediscovers his scoring touch. In contrast, Watford’s Troy Deeney has scored three times in the last four games and Walter Mazzarri has challenged his centre forward to break into the England team. Louise Taylor"
597,Liverpool,Manchester United,Fri 14 Oct 2016 16.44 BST,2016-17,"José Mourinho has lost only three of his 10 visits to Anfield, the last in the 2007 Champions League semi-final, but the implications of a fourth would be sizeable for both Manchester United and Liverpool. Defeat for United would leave them six points behind their fierce north-west rivals and encourage the portrayal of Mourinho as a manager left behind by the pressing instincts of Jürgen Klopp and co, despite being only eight league matches into his Old Trafford reign. Klopp has injury concerns, however, over two thirds of his central midfield in Adam Lallana and Georginio Wijnaldum. Andy Hunter"
598,Manchester City,Everton,Fri 14 Oct 2016 16.21 BST,2016-17,"Manchester City can bounce straight back from their first loss at Tottenham and stretch the gap between themselves and Everton to seven points. Kevin De Bruyne could start after his injury but whether Pep Guardiola will risk him before Wednesday’s trip to Barcelona is the question.

I’m focused on improving my team, and I have good communication and a good relationship with the club. I take this with a smile.” He will retain his back three against Leicester, pointless away from home to date, and must decide whether John Terry returns to his lineup after injury. Dominic Fifield"

His time at White Hart Lane fizzled out, and he found a starting berth hard to come by. Yet he has impressed at The Hawthorns, becoming they key creator for Tony Pulis’s team. Finding a way past Spurs will still be difficult though. Alan Smith"
601,Bournemouth,Hull City,Fri 14 Oct 2016 14.57 BST,2016-17,"After finally being given the full-time manager’s job on Thursday, Mike Phelan takes charge of Hull City on a permanent basis for the first time. It’s perhaps not one of the toughest trips at first glance, but Bournemouth are searching for a third straight home win in the Premier League. The on-loan Arsenal midfielder Jack Wilshere, who last played 90 minutes more than two years ago, is again likely to start behind the striker Callum Wilson, who is beginning to show glimpses of his best form. Ben Fisher"
602,Arsenal,Swansea City,Fri 14 Oct 2016 14.43 BST,2016-17,"Bob Bradley has demonstrated his ability to talk the talk, as anybody present at his Swansea media unveiling will attest – now, he has to walk the walk, at a stadium where his side have fared well of late. Arsène Wenger said the American’s appointment was “good for the Premier League, because it is taking off in the States”, but the Arsenal manager’s concern is to record a home league win over Swansea for the first time since 2011. David Hytner"
603,Crystal Palace,West Ham United,Fri 14 Oct 2016 12.45 BST,2016-17,"West Ham United would appear to be there for the taking. A team struggling to adapt to a new home have yet to gain anything other than bloodied noses away from Stratford this term, with nine goals conceded in three defeats. Yet Alan Pardew and Crystal Palace are still braced for an awkward derby. West Ham have won 3-1 on their last two visits to Selhurst Park, “and they’ve got some fantastic players, players of international standard or even world-class ability,” offered Pardew.

604,Manchester United,Stoke City,Fri 30 Sep 2016 18.26 BST,2016-17,"After three defeats in a row for Manchester United, three wins on the bounce have followed. Only one of those was in the league – a 4-1 rout of Leicester – and José Mourinho’s side were stodgy in Thursday’s Europa League win over Zorya Luhansk. Stodgy is just about acceptable to fans if it leads to victory, so second-bottom Stoke City have to be beaten. United also need to go on the kind of run serious championship challengers make.

An open, high-tempo showdown looms, which will be scrutinised for title pointers. David Hytner"
606,Leicester City,Southampton,Fri 30 Sep 2016 17.35 BST,2016-17,"Following a defensive capitulation against Manchester United last Saturday, Leicester kept a clean sheet against Porto in their first home Champions League fixture.

However Slaven Bilic is under pressure. West Ham have lost five of their first six league matches and Middlesbrough, who are winless since 21 August, will spy an opportunity to put distance between themselves and the bottom three. Jacob Steinberg"
610,Burnley,Arsenal,Fri 30 Sep 2016 16.17 BST,2016-17,"This, curiously, is Burnley’s fifth home game in the opening seven rounds. Seven points from their Turf Moor fixtures to date has been a decent return and Monday night’s comfortable win over Watford gives the Clarets momentum going into Arsenal’s visit. Sean Dyche’s decision to bolster the midfield in the absence of Andre Gray paid off and he is unlikely to deviate from that setup against Arsenal, who have won six matches in seven. Victory would be Burnley’s first in the league against Arsenal for 42 years. Nick Ames"

612,Swansea City,Liverpool,Fri 30 Sep 2016 14.18 BST,2016-17,"Swansea performed well in defeat to Manchester City last weekend but Francesco Guidolin is still living on borrowed time. The Italian could badly do with a result against Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool, who have at times been exhilarating in attack. Guidolin says he could “maybe” lose his job with another loss but “if we win, for the international break you don’t speak any more about my position”. No pressure, then. Alan Smith"

The bad news for Swansea is that Sergio Agüero is back from suspension, which is the last thing Francesco Guidolin needs right now.

Later the two former centre halves were fast tracked through their coaching badges on the same course in Madrid. Back then they could surely never have guessed that, almost a decade on, they would be reunited on Teesside with Karanka’s Middlesbrough hosting the Argentinian’s Tottenham. After straight defeats against Crystal Palace and Everton, Boro could do with a win and will hope to capitalise on Harry Kane’s absence. Louise Taylor"
615,Manchester United,Leicester City,Fri 23 Sep 2016 18.14 BST,2016-17,"Six points is already the gap to Manchester City as José Mourinho chases a desperately required win and decides whether to drop Wayne Rooney. The Portuguese is intent on ensuring Paul Pogba plays in his best position, so expect him on the left of a Manchester United 4-3-3. If, then, the captain is to be accommodated Anthony Martial’s injury may allow Rooney to play on the left of the front three. Jamie Jackson"
616,Arsenal,Chelsea,Fri 23 Sep 2016 17.43 BST,2016-17,Arsène Wenger calls them “the inconvenient facts of the recent years”. To Chelsea it has been capital city supremacy. In the previous 10 editions of this fixture – excluding the Community Shield – the west London club have won seven times and there have been three draws. Wenger has called on his Arsenal players to buck the trend and nullifying Diego Costa is at the top of his agenda. The subplots are numerous and rich. Expect fireworks. David Hytner
617,Sunderland,Crystal Palace,Fri 23 Sep 2016 16.24 BST,2016-17,"As Newcastle United manager, Alan Pardew suffered horribly at the hands of Sunderland and he would hardly be human were he not particularly keen to see Crystal Palace celebrate victory on Wearside. Such an event would represent a significant blow to David Moyes who is desperate to secure his first league win at Sunderland. Doing so will have to see his side attack more fluently as they have unleashed the fewest shots in the top tier this season and scored only three goals in their opening five fixtures. Louise Taylor"
618,Burnley,Watford,Fri 23 Sep 2016 16.02 BST,2016-17,Sean Dyche might have been particularly confident of getting one over his old club had this fixture taken place two weeks ago but Watford have taken off since and Burnley begin Monday night’s game on the back of a 3-0 defeat at Leicester. They used a more cautious 4-2-3-1 shape at the King Power Stadium but may recall Sam Vokes to their normal 4-4-2 here or even hand a first start to loanee Patrick Bamford. Johann Berg Gudmundsson is another who could be recalled if Dyche fancies starting on the front foot.Nick Ames
619,Liverpool,Hull City,Fri 23 Sep 2016 15.47 BST,2016-17,"Mike Phelan is unbeaten in four away matches as caretaker manager of Hull but confronts a Liverpool team that has clicked impressively and is seeking a fourth consecutive win in all competitions. Jürgen Klopp has a big call to make in goal, with Loris Karius pressing Simon Mignolet for inclusion, and faces a sustained test of Liverpool’s consistency with five of their next six games after Hull coming against sides who beat them last season. Hence the manager’s plea for patience from the Anfield crowd. Andy Hunter"
620,Stoke City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 23 Sep 2016 15.27 BST,2016-17,"If a degree of pressure was removed from Tony Pulis’s shoulders after West Brom’s win over West Ham, the knives will be out in force at his old club if Mark Hughes’s side fails again here. How Hughes can arrest a slump that has brought four limp defeats in a row, along with a League Cup exit to Hull, is anyone’s guess but Stoke’s treatment table is at least clearing and Xherdan Shaqiri may be able to play some part after recovering from the calf injury that has sidelined him since the opening day. Nick Ames"
621,Bournemouth,Everton,Fri 23 Sep 2016 13.00 BST,2016-17,"Everton travel to Bournemouth aware that victory could take them top of the Premier League. Regardless of that, it’s another opportunity for Ronald Koeman’s side to showcase their intentions, while they can extend their unbeaten start in the league to six matches. Romelu Lukaku, who has scored five goals already this month, is expected to return from a toe injury after missing the midweek EFL Cup defeat by Norwich City. This fixture last season acted as a springboard for Bournemouth, who equalised in the eighth minute of stoppage time to record a 3-3 draw. The neutrals, and Bournemouth, would most probably settle for the same again this time around. Ben Fisher"
622,West Ham United,Southampton,Fri 23 Sep 2016 12.29 BST,2016-17,"West Ham United could be bottom by the time they take on Southampton. At least Dimitri Payet’s late winner against Accrington Stanley in the EFL Cup restored some belief. Yet it is likely to be another fraught afternoon at the London Stadium, on and off the pitch, unless West Ham plug the holes in their defence. Meanwhile, Claude Puel’s side are looking for their fourth straight win in all competitions. Jacob Steinberg"
623,Leicester City,Burnley,Fri 16 Sep 2016 18.05 BST,2016-17,"Back to reality for Leicester, who host newly promoted Burnley less than 72 hours after hammering Club Brugge on their Champions League debut. Danny Simpson is fit again and Islam Slimani is in line to make his first Premier League appearance as the champions go in search of a second league win. Burnley, who also have four points from their opening four matches, could prove to be more awkward opponents than Brugge. Club-record signing Jeff Hendrick is set to make his first start for Sean Dyche’s side. Stuart James"
624,Southampton,Swansea City,Fri 16 Sep 2016 17.34 BST,2016-17,Thursday’s Europa League victory over Sparta Prague gave Claude Puel the first win of his reign and some welcome selection options. Charlie Austin put forward a strong case for a start against Swansea by scoring twice against the Czechs and the whole team looked comfortable in a 4-3-3 formation. The manager could build on that performance as he seeks his first Premier League win. Paul Doyle
625,Manchester City,Bournemouth,Fri 16 Sep 2016 16.44 BST,2016-17,"The record shows a magnificent seven wins from seven outings for Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City. The Catalan is already creating the myth that a side can be beaten before they walk past the white line for kick-off. Can, then, Bournemouth do what no other side has yet and, at least, fashion a draw? It appears a slim prospect even though City are without the sublime and prolific Sergio Agüero, who is suspended. Jamie Jackson"
626,Watford,Manchester United,Fri 16 Sep 2016 15.49 BST,2016-17,"After a strong start to their season Manchester United find themselves on a two-game losing streak. Watford’s impressive four-goal comeback against West Ham last Saturday means United need to be wary. That said, José Mourinho is a chip-on-his-shoulder specialist and will no doubt be drilling into his side that victory must be the only outcome to keep up with their noisy neighbours. Graham Searles"
627,West Bromwich Albion,West Ham United,Fri 16 Sep 2016 15.11 BST,2016-17,Tony Pulis remains in charge at West Bromwich Albion but for how much longer? The manager’s weakened relationship with club hierarchy has dominated the buildup to this game. For West Ham so much has been made of the teething problems at their new stadium that their below-par start to the season has not been given as much attention as perhaps it should. Both could badly do with a win. Alan Smith
628,Tottenham Hotspur,Sunderland,Fri 16 Sep 2016 14.46 BST,2016-17,"The disappointment of Tottenham’s midweek Champions League defeat by Monaco at Wembley cut deep, with Mauricio Pochettino particularly upset at what he saw as a lack of intensity and decisiveness. The manager wants Sunderland to feel the backlash and, with David Moyes experiencing plenty of problems at the north-east club, Tottenham have a good opportunity to bounce back. Sunderland, winless and joint-bottom of the table, have a dismal record at White Hart Lane. David Hytner"
629,Hull City,Arsenal,Fri 16 Sep 2016 14.36 BST,2016-17,"Mike Phelan would virtually guarantee being appointed manager of Hull by beating Arsenal after a strong start to his time as caretaker. However, the likelihood is slim considering the home side have beaten Arsenal once in 18 meetings. Arsène Wenger should have great faith three points will be banked here. The visitors have been prolific at the Kcom Stadium, winning five out of five. Graham Searles"
630,Everton,Middlesbrough,Fri 16 Sep 2016 13.57 BST,2016-17,"Middlesbrough have made a solid return to the top flight but their hosts will be full of confidence having made their best start to a campaign for a decade. Gareth Barry will join Ryan Giggs and Frank Lampard in the Premier League’s 600-club, 18 years after his debut for Aston Villa at Sheffield Wednesday, but whether Ross Barkley will join the immaculate veteran in midfield remains to be seen. Ronald Koeman has not shied from the big calls on the England international, on the pitch or in public. Romelu Lukaku is back among the goals after his hat-trick at Sunderland. Andy Hunter"
631,Crystal Palace,Stoke City,Fri 16 Sep 2016 12.13 BST,2016-17,"Crystal Palace’s latest attempt to rejuvenate their home form will be undertaken without Pape Souaré, who faces up to six months out with the injuries sustained in Sunday’s car crash on the M4. Alan Pardew and his players have visited the Senegalese in hospital this week and that might focus minds against Stoke, who prop up the division. Mark Hughes’ side have not prevailed in any of their last six games against Palace. They, too, are in need of a revival. Dominic Fifield"
632,Sunderland,Everton,Fri 9 Sep 2016 18.16 BST,2016-17,"Once so synonymous with Everton, David Moyes finds himself plotting the potential downfall of the team he managed for more than a decade. He will be assisted on the pitch by fellow Goodison Park old boys Steven Pienaar and Jack Rodwell, while a not yet fully fit Victor Anichebe looks on from the sidelines as Sunderland seek a morale-boosting first league win of the season. It should be particularly interesting to see how Lamine Koné, an £18m Everton transfer target this summer, performs in the home defence. Louise Taylor"
633,Swansea City,Chelsea,Fri 9 Sep 2016 17.59 BST,2016-17,"Borja Bastón, Swansea’s record signing, could make his debut for the hosts (assuming the striker has sufficiently recovered from a thigh injury) and will immediately be tasked with getting the better of David Luiz. The Brazilian’s return to Chelsea caught many by surprise but Antonio Conte thinks the 29-year-old could still become one of the world’s best defenders. Alan Smith"
634,Arsenal,Southampton,Fri 9 Sep 2016 17.18 BST,2016-17,"Shkodran Mustafi could make his Arsenal debut and Lucas Pérez is also available for his first appearance. Arsène Wenger said he has the “most mature squad for a long time” but they will not find it easy against Southampton, who will be hoping Fraser Forster is fit after missing England’s trip to Slovakia with an arm injury. Ryan Bertrand is also available. Alan Smith"
635,Stoke City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 9 Sep 2016 16.48 BST,2016-17,"Stoke’s injury problems show little sign of abating and their task will become harder if Tottenham inflict a third defeat in four games. Xherdan Shaqiri and Mame Biram Diouf are the latest casualties although there should be debuts for the defender Bruno Martins Indi and, up front, Wilfried Bony, both signed on loan before the deadline. Mark Hughes must decide whether to persist with a relatively conservative three-man central midfield against Tottenham, whose own start has been more solid than spectacular. Nick Ames"
636,West Ham United,Watford,Fri 9 Sep 2016 15.57 BST,2016-17,"Last season’s star player, Dimitri Payet, and recent signing from Juventus, Simone Zaza, are set to be included from the start by Slaven Bilic against a Watford side who have had a tough start to the season. Another former Juve player, Robert Pereyra, should start for the visitors, having made his debut from the bench in the defeat at home to Arsenal. Alan Smith"
637,Manchester United,Manchester City,Fri 9 Sep 2016 15.31 BST,2016-17,"After the hype, the match. The Manchester derby will offer clues about how United and City will fare this season and nothing more. Students of body language, the media, and fans will watch José Mourinho and Pep Guardiola, particularly around handshake time, but remember this: all that matters is what occurs on the pitch. The prospect is enticing. Jamie Jackson"
638,Burnley,Hull City,Fri 9 Sep 2016 14.52 BST,2016-17,"If proof were needed the Premier League rarely goes as one would expect, Burnley’s first two home games – a defeat to Swansea and a win over Liverpool – have underlined the point. A 3-0 defeat at Chelsea was rather more predictable but it is hard to know what to expect against a Hull side who were seconds away from an unbeaten start before losing to Manchester United. Jeff Hendrick should make his debut after a record move from Derby County, either in the middle or on the flanks Nick Ames"
639,Liverpool,Leicester City,Fri 9 Sep 2016 13.34 BST,2016-17,"Jürgen Klopp wants Liverpool to “use the power” of the extra 8,500 fans who will attend the club’s first home game of the season following the opening of the new £114m main stand at Anfield. Anticipation is rife having spent August on the road and with the champions representing an awkward return home. Both Liverpool and Leicester have had a mixed start but will be looking to build on encouraging displays before the international break. Leicester’s £30m summer signing Islam Slimani could make his debut. Andy Hunter"
640,Middlesbrough,Crystal Palace,Fri 9 Sep 2016 13.06 BST,2016-17,"As if the potential beauty contest between those formidable centre forwards - Álvaro Negredo and Christian Benteke - was not sufficiently compelling, Alan Pardew has spiced things up by naming two Bentekes in his squad. Christian’s younger brother, and fellow striker, Jonathan is expected to be on the bench against a Middlesbrough side unbeaten in the league. Palace have only one point but might the pair’s respective early season positions be deceptive? An intriguing litmus test - not to mention clash of two contrasting counter-attacking styles - beckons. Louise Taylor"
641,Bournemouth,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 9 Sep 2016 12.39 BST,2016-17,"Eddie Howe is expected to give Jack Wilshere his competitive debut, although the manager revealed he has had to manage the midfielder’s workload. “We have to get the balance right between getting him fitter and making sure he does not break down,” said Howe. Wilshere’s last league goal for Arsenal was in May 2015 against West Brom, whose manager, Tony Pulis, coached Howe as a teenager. Ben Fisher"
642,Watford,Arsenal,Fri 26 Aug 2016 17.59 BST,2016-17,"With Arsenal already five points behind in the title race after only two games, Arsène Wenger needs a victory at Vicarage Road. Not that Walter Mazzarri’s Watford are without their own concerns after losing their past two matches. Mazzarri has been busy in the transfer window but the new signings Roberto Pereyra, Younès Kaboul and Daryl Janmaat are unlikely to start. Paul MacInnes"
643,Southampton,Sunderland,Fri 26 Aug 2016 17.38 BST,2016-17,"David Moyes upset some fans by suggesting this week that Sunderland should expect to find themselves in another relegation fight this season if reinforcements are not bought soon. But the lack of ambition in the manager’s approach on the pitch in Sunderland’s first two matches should be of more concern. Moyes would be well advised to get a better display from his side at St Mary’s, where Southampton’s manager, Claude Puel, is looking for a first league win. Paul Doyle"
644,Everton,Stoke City,Fri 26 Aug 2016 17.27 BST,2016-17,"Romelu Lukaku changed the game from the bench in the 2-1 win at West Brom and is expected to lead the line against a Stoke side looking for an unprecedented third win in a row at Goodison. The last was a 4-3 thriller in December and Xherdan Shaqiri, who scored twice in that game, should be back while Peter Crouch is keen for an airing after his midweek hat-trick at Stevenage. Mark Tallentire"
645,Tottenham Hotspur,Liverpool,Fri 26 Aug 2016 17.08 BST,2016-17,"A lot has happened since Jürgen Klopp’s first game in charge of Liverpool at White Hart Lane last October but not so much has changed. Problems with consistency continue , which Klopp had alluded to well before their chastening defeat by Burnley last weekend. Tottenham Hotspur, too, are yet to find top gear this season after stuttering to their first win of the season against Crystal Palace but Klopp is wary of their talents. “We know they are strong, that’s the only thing we need to know,” he said. “We can be strong too and should show this on Saturday.” Ben Fisher"
646,Leicester City,Swansea City,Fri 26 Aug 2016 16.44 BST,2016-17,"Leicester City, while not desperate for a win, could use a momentum-building victory against Swansea City before their Champions League debut. Claudio Ranieri will be hoping for better service to, and better finishing from, Jamie Vardy, who has yet to record a shot on target this season. If Swansea inflict another defeat on the champions, panic could take hold of Leicester’s pizzerias. Graham Searles"
647,Manchester City,West Ham United,Fri 26 Aug 2016 15.58 BST,2016-17,"So far, so very good for the Pep Guardiola Manchester City project. A disrupted pre-season is no longer a factor and the Catalan’s side are flying. What will fascinate is when the Pep bounce falters and his side suffer a defeat. Slaven Bilic’s West Ham United won at the Etihad Stadium 2-1 last season, so might they be the team to offer City a first taste of adversity? Jamie Jackson"
648,West Bromwich Albion,Middlesbrough,Fri 26 Aug 2016 15.25 BST,2016-17,"This will be the first meeting between these sides since 2010 but the recent record is overwhelmingly in favour of the host club. Albion have won the past four, scoring 11 goals without conceding one – including 5-0 and 3-0 wins. Yet Middlesbrough will fancy their chances of a win following a solid start to the season – despite the midweek cup loss at Fulham. It will be close. Alan Smith"
649,Chelsea,Burnley,Fri 26 Aug 2016 14.53 BST,2016-17,"Burnley’s eye-catching win over Liverpool last weekend served as a warning to Chelsea that a fixture which once might have been considered a likely walkover actually has the potential to be awkward. “They are a very solid team in defensive situations, and always ready to go on the counter-attack with two forwards,” said Antonio Conte, who was impressed by Sean Dyche when the pair met at a coaches’ meeting in pre-season. “This is dangerous.” All three of his side’s successes to date have been narrow and nerve-jangling. This, too, should prove tight. Dominic Fifield"
650,Crystal Palace,Bournemouth,Fri 26 Aug 2016 14.29 BST,2016-17,"Something will have to give at Selhurst Park. These sides are currently pointless at the foot of the table, with Crystal Palace having been undone by set-pieces in each of their games and Christian Benteke’s lack of match fitness likely to see the record signing start on the bench. Wilfried Zaha may join him there after asking to leave this week. Bournemouth won in south-east London earlier this year as they surged to safety and Palace slipped the other way. This could condemn one of the sides to an international window dogged by self-doubt. Dominic Fifield"
651,Sunderland,Middlesbrough,Fri 19 Aug 2016 18.24 BST,2016-17,"While Wear-Tees clashes lack the fierce intensity of their Tyne-Wear cousins – the clubs are 35 miles apart – the atmosphere will still be highly charged. If David Moyes must trust Younès Kaboul’s defection to Watford does not leave Álvaro Negredo scenting blood, Jermain Defoe would relish defying Víctor Valdés. For the past five seasons Sunderland have failed to win a league game in August but, much as Moyes wants to put that right in his first home league match with his new club, Aitor Karanka could do with a derby win. Louise Taylor"
652,West Ham United,Bournemouth,Fri 19 Aug 2016 18.08 BST,2016-17,"Losing at Chelsea on Monday before playing in Romania on Thursday night was not the ideal way for West Ham United to prepare for their Premier League debut in their new ground. It has been a slow start to the season for the Hammers and Slaven Bilic will hope to have Dimitri Payet available from the start. Bournemouth, beaten by Manchester United last weekend, won this fixture last year thanks to Callum Wilson’s hat-trick. Jacob Steinberg"
653,West Bromwich Albion,Everton,Fri 19 Aug 2016 17.50 BST,2016-17,"West Bromwich Albion and Yannick Bolasie could face each other for the second consecutive weekend after the attacker moved from Crystal Palace to Everton in midweek. Ronald Koeman will need to decide whether to use him from the start or as a substitute, though that could depend on the fitness of Romelu Lukaku. Ashley Williams’ availability is also touch and go for the visitors. Alan Smith"
654,Stoke City,Manchester City,Fri 19 Aug 2016 17.21 BST,2016-17,"Can Pep Guardiola do it on a temperate afternoon in Stoke? Quite probably, unless the home side start more quickly than they did at Middlesbrough. last week. Mark Hughes waits on the fitness of Xherdan Shaqiri, whose free-kick illuminated a much better second half, before deciding who faces his old club and will have to continue with another City old boy, the 40-year-old Shay Given, in goal while Jack Butland is laid low. Guardiola has no such issues; his own first-choice keeper, Willy Caballero, is fighting fit. Nick Ames"
655,Tottenham Hotspur,Crystal Palace,Fri 19 Aug 2016 16.59 BST,2016-17,"Crystal Palace looked bereft of ideas in attack against West Brom on the opening day and they cross London this afternoon with Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie no longer in their ranks. Connor Wickham will be keen to impress before Christian Benteke gets involved. It all points to a first win of the campaign for Tottenham, following on from their draw against Everton last weekend. Alan Smith"
656,Watford,Chelsea,Fri 19 Aug 2016 16.38 BST,2016-17,"Despite the best intentions of both managers this reunion has been billed as a grudge match. Antonio Conte earned Walter Mazzarri’s ire after mimicking his formation in a crunch Serie A fixture five years ago. He looks set to name an unchanged side after Chelsea’s late win over West Ham on Monday. The arrival of Younès Kaboul and Argentine midfielder Roberto Pereyra meanwhile will come too late for Watford this weekend, for whom Ben Watson is also suspended after his red card against Southampton. Paul MacInnes"
657,Swansea City,Hull City,Fri 19 Aug 2016 15.48 BST,2016-17,"The opening day brought welcome victories for both clubs – unexpectedly so in the case of Hull, who have not added to their threadbare squad since beating Leicester and remain without a permanent manager. Gylfi Sigurdsson, who came off the bench at Burnley, could start for Swansea. Borja Baston, Swansea’s club-record signing, has been ruled out with a thigh injury, Neil Taylor is being given more time to recover from Euro 2016 and Leon Britton has been laid low with illness this week. Stuart James"
658,Burnley,Liverpool,Fri 19 Aug 2016 15.33 BST,2016-17,"Two consecutive home games might have appeared an agreeable reintroduction to top-flight football for Burnley but it will not feel that way if last week’s defeat to Swansea is followed by another. Steven Defour should make his debut in midfield with David Jones having joined Sheffield Wednesday; Sean Dyche must wait to field Jon Flanagan, unavailable as he is on loan from Liverpool. An active Liverpool full-back, Alberto Moreno, was criticised after the 4-3 win at Arsenal but will retain his place after being backed by Jürgen Klopp. Nick Ames"
659,Leicester City,Arsenal,Fri 19 Aug 2016 13.28 BST,2016-17,"The season has barely got under way and yet, on the back of defeats on the opening weekend, this already feels like a significant game for both clubs. Arsenal did the double over Leicester last season but were second best to them where it really mattered and they also failed in an attempt to sign Jamie Vardy in the summer. Robert Huth is back from suspension for Leicester while Laurent Koscielny, Mesut Özil and Olivier Giroud could all return for Arsenal. Stuart James"
660,Southampton,Watford,Fri 12 Aug 2016 19.10 BST,2016-17,"Both clubs go into the new season with new managers for the first time since Alan Pardew and Malky Mackay were in charge of the respective clubs.

661,Hull City,Leicester City,Fri 12 Aug 2016 18.42 BST,2016-17,"Leicester City could hardly face an easier opening to their title defence. Managerless Hull City, with only 13 fit professionals, look ripe for the taking. The home side will be particularly short in defence, with three centre-backs – Alex Bruce, Harry Maguire and the captain, Michael Dawson – injured, as well as the goalkeeper Alan McGregor. Suspension means Robert Huth is the only notable absentee for Leicester, who may give a debut to Ahmed Musa. Paul Macinnes"
662,Everton,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 12 Aug 2016 18.01 BST,2016-17,"Two teams that a season ago may have considered themselves equals come into the new campaign worlds apart. Ronald Koeman is in the process of rebuilding a squad that is lacking defensively, while Mauricio Pochettino will hope for further development from his talented young group. Everton have drawn their past three opening games 2-2, and a fourth would see them reach eight winless matches against Tottenham. Conor Matchett"
663,Arsenal,Liverpool,Fri 12 Aug 2016 17.48 BST,2016-17,"Arsène Wenger is expected to be without a number of players on fitness grounds and he will be forced to field a makeshift central defensive partnership. It is easy to feel that the new season has come too soon for him and Arsenal, and Liverpool, who have injury concerns of their own, will seek to heighten the nagging anxiety at the Emirates. They do, however, have a poor away record against Arsenal, winning only once in 20 matches across 15 years. David Hytner"
664,Manchester City,Sunderland,Fri 12 Aug 2016 17.41 BST,2016-17,"However much Pep Guardiola tries to downplay it, all eyes watch the impact he will make. For now, with Vincent Kompany injured, he welcomes David Moyes’s side with a defence featuring new signing John Stones plunged straight in, so a win by any manner will do. Yet given the club’s riches and the 45-year-old’s pedigree there is no excuse for Guardiola not to have City as serious contenders. The missions starts here. Jamie Jackson"
665,Chelsea,West Ham United,Fri 12 Aug 2016 17.07 BST,2016-17,This could be the game of the opening weekend. Antonio Conte may need some time to leave his mark on Chelsea but there is justified excitement at Stamford Bridge after last season’s horrors. West Ham arrive with two competitive games under their belt after progressing in the Europa League and it will be fascinating to see if Slaven Bilic can improve on last year’s fine performance. Alan Smith
666,Bournemouth,Manchester United,Fri 12 Aug 2016 16.16 BST,2016-17,"José Mourinho’s penultimate match in charge of Chelsea ended in a chastening defeat by Bournemouth at Stamford Bridge, so his first Premier League match as Manchester United manager may feel remotely familiar. Mourinho will hope the summer arrivals, namely Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Henrikh Mkhitaryan can ensure a different outcome against Eddie Howe’s men this time around. “Zlatan is a great player, but you can pick any one of their players who will be a threat to us,” said Howe, who could give debuts to Jordon Ibe and Lewis Cook. “We’re looking forward to the game.” Ben Fisher"
667,Crystal Palace,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 12 Aug 2016 15.59 BST,2016-17,"On paper this game between two of last season’s three lowest scoring sides may suggest a shortage of goals but their most recent meeting, at The Hawthorns in February, was a 3-2 classic. Yannick Bolasie looks to be on his way out of Palace but Alan Pardew expects him to be involved here, while Saido Berahino is in the visitors’ squad despite a chance he will move to Selhurst Park. Alan Smith"
668,Burnley,Swansea City,Fri 12 Aug 2016 14.29 BST,2016-17,This already has the feel of a game that will set the tone for both clubs’ fortunes. Burnley should give a debut to Johann Berg Gudmundsson but he is their only outfield signing so far – Aston Villa’s Ashley Westwood may follow – and there are concerns that last season’s Championship winners are thin on numbers and quality. Swansea must adjust to losing Ashley Williams and André Ayew in quick succession and the match comes too soon for record signing Borja Bastón. Both squads should look stronger at the month’s end but a negative start could be hard to claw back. Nick Ames

Boro fans will be keen to take a first look at Víctor Valdés, Álvaro Negredo, Marten de Roon et al, while Joe Allen is set to make his Stoke debut following a £13m move from Liverpool. Given that Karanka’s side conceded only eight Championship goals at home last season Mark Hughes must trust his strikers are wearing their shooting boots. Louise Taylor"

Rafael Benítez, though, wants to extend already relegated Newcastle’s five-game unbeaten run on an afternoon when home fans are planning to serenade the Spaniard in the hope of persuading him to stick around next season and lead them out of the second tier. Tyneside’s Evening Chronicle devoted Friday’s front page to imploring Benítez to stay but some fear Everton might steal him. Louise Taylor"
671,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Fri 13 May 2016 18.28 BST,2015-16,"Arsenal have an outside chance of finishing second, which they have not done since 2004-05 and so it is possible that a campaign marked by frustration and volatility could end on something of a positive. It would be sweet for them if they could pip Tottenham and finish above them as they always do but thoughts have already turned to next season. The mood and the attendance at the Emirates will be interesting. Villa just want it all to stop. David Hytner"
672,Watford,Sunderland,Fri 13 May 2016 17.52 BST,2015-16,"One club, the fifth biggest in the league if ranked by stadium capacity, is delighted just to have avoided relegation; the other, recently promoted and 18th in the same rankings, is so disappointed to have spent the season in mid-table that they have just disposed of their manager. Sunderland will come 17th whatever happens but go into the gameare on a wave of survivalist euphoria; Watford could finish as low as 16th or as high as 11th, a difference of £6,180,415 in “merit payments”, but motivation may still be an issue. Simon Burnton"
673,Stoke City,West Ham United,Fri 13 May 2016 17.27 BST,2015-16,Victory for West Ham will ensure that they qualify for the Europa League and they could finish fifth if Manchester United slip up against Bournemouth. But will Slaven Bilic’s side be emotionally drained after their dramatic victory over United in the final game at Upton Park on Tuesday? Stoke City will be eager to end on a high and hold on to their place in the top 10 after picking up two points from their past six games. Jacob Steinberg
674,Southampton,Crystal Palace,Fri 13 May 2016 17.12 BST,2015-16,"Six wins from their last eight games have propelled Southampton up the table and they know victory tomorrow could be enough for them to steal sixth, and even possibly fifth place. Alan Pardew returns to a club where he had perhaps his least impressive spell in management with next Saturday’s FA Cup final on his mind, even more so after Joe Ledley’s unfortunate leg-break against Stoke last week, so an under-strength Crystal Palace side is a distinct possibility. Paul Chronnell"
675,Manchester United,Bournemouth,Fri 13 May 2016 16.52 BST,2015-16,"The question for Manchester United fans is simple and painful: how did it come to needing to beat Bournemouth and Manchester City to lose at Swansea to qualify for the Champions League? This is the barest of requirements for the United behemoth and expect Louis van Gaal’s job to be severely scrutinised should they end the season, as they begin Sunday as favourites to do, outside the top four. Jamie Jackson"
676,Everton,Norwich City,Fri 13 May 2016 16.17 BST,2015-16,"An afternoon with David Unsworth, Joe Royle and Duncan Ferguson sounds more like a sportsman’s dinner than a Premier League fixture but the trio of ex-Evertonians will lift Goodison Park’s mood following the sacking of Roberto Martínez. The visit of relegated Norwich City would have been a mutinous, horrible affair had Martínez been kept on for one more game and it will be revealing if his former players suddenly show more commitment than they have done in recent weeks. Andy Hunter"
677,Chelsea,Leicester City,Fri 13 May 2016 16.02 BST,2015-16,"The football at Stamford Bridge will almost feel incidental. More enticing will be the joyous reception granted the returning Claudio Ranieri with Roman Abramovich, the man who sacked him back in 2004, potentially watching on from his box in the West stand. Then there will be the accolades for Leicester City’schampions, and a second farewell to Guus Hiddink. Beyond that, the locals will merely be thankful this trying campaign is finally over. Dominic Fifield"
678,West Bromwich Albion,Liverpool,Fri 13 May 2016 15.07 BST,2015-16,"With Liverpool’s focus very much on Wednesday’s Europa League final against Sevilla in Basel, Jürgen Klopp is likely to name an under-strength side for the final league game. That could help Tony Pulis’s attempts to deliver some entertainment to Albion fans in their final match of a season in which they have steered clear of trouble but had precious few reasons to cheer. Paul Doyle"
679,Swansea City,Manchester City,Fri 13 May 2016 14.34 BST,2015-16,"West Ham’s late heroics on Tuesday night put Manchester City’s destiny back in their own hands and avoiding defeat tomorrow will suffice for them to finish in fourth place, even if hoping for Arsenal to lose at home to Aston Villa to have a chance of third may be pushing it. There were times this season when being comfortably safe on the last day looked highly unlikely for Swansea, and while the decision to award Francesco Guidolin the job full-time this week was a surprise, it was a deserved one. The Italian has probably done enough since succeeding Garry Monk to deserve a crack at a season from the start. Paul Chronnell"
680,Sunderland,Chelsea,Fri 6 May 2016 17.57 BST,2015-16,Sunderland really need to win this to keep their survival hopes intact but considering they have not scored in their last three home games and how they have historically struggled against last season’s champions – winning only two of the past 24 meetings – it will not be easy. Sam Allardyce’s team will also know Norwich’s result by the time they get under way potentially adding more pressure. Alan Smith
681,Aston Villa,Newcastle United,Fri 6 May 2016 17.33 BST,2015-16,"Three points are a must for Newcastle to stay ahead in the race to avoid relegation. Rafael Benítez has provided United with a new-found confidence and, unbeaten in four, they should really have the measure of a Villa side whose embarrassing run of defeats now stands at 11. While they scored twice in their past two games, a shambolic defence has shipped four and three in the process. Alan Smith"
682,Norwich City,Manchester United,Fri 6 May 2016 17.12 BST,2015-16,Alex Neil felt last weekend’s defeat at Arsenal was their best away performance against one of the bigger teams this season but the clock is ticking at speed now and three consecutive defeats – with no goals scored – have come at the worst possible time. Another home game in midweek against Watford is an opportunity to pick up points but they cannot afford to have fallen further adrift by then and something is surely required from an upbeat Manchester United. Nick Ames
683,Manchester City,Arsenal,Fri 6 May 2016 17.00 BST,2015-16,"Manchester City know if Manchester United and West Ham United lose their respective matches then victory over Arsenal secures a place in next season’s Champions League. For the away side, a draw for each of the Uniteds means Arsenal cannot be overtaken in their quest for a place in the top four. Whatever the results beforehand, expect both sides to go for the win their instincts demand. Jamie Jackson"
684,Tottenham Hotspur,Southampton,Fri 6 May 2016 16.09 BST,2015-16,"There is not, generally, a massive difference between coming in second rather than third but, for Tottenham, it would mean the world. The disappointment of their collapsed Premier League title push is still fresh but there remains the significant matter of finishing above Arsenal for the first time since 1994-95. Tottenham have guaranteed themselves a place in the top three but the runners-up spot would ensure that they finally enjoy supremacy in their neighbourhood. Southampton’s motivation continues to be Europa League qualification. David Hytner"
685,West Ham United,Swansea City,Fri 6 May 2016 15.50 BST,2015-16,"Swansea banished any lingering relegation fears with Sunday’s win over Liverpool, and their thoughts are now surely turning to finding a manager for next season. West Ham still have European places to play for, however, and while this penultimate game at Upton Park will be upstaged by Manchester United’s visit on Tuesday, Slaven Bilic has not given up on scraping into the top four. Paul Chronnell"
686,Liverpool,Watford,Fri 6 May 2016 15.31 BST,2015-16,"The Europa League final may be Liverpool’s focus, and Jürgen Klopp has confirmed the intensity of Thursday’s semi-final against Villarreal will influence his selection against Watford, but cup final places and the desire to finish higher than eighth should provide sufficient motivation at Anfield. Klopp cites the 3-0 defeat at Vicarage Road as one of the worst displays of his Liverpool tenure and will not want his players bullied again by Quique Sánchez Flores’s team. Andy Hunter"
687,Crystal Palace,Stoke City,Fri 6 May 2016 15.14 BST,2015-16,"Alan Pardew’s instinct will be to protect his players for the club’s second FA Cup final later this month but Crystal Palace, hampered by strains and sniffles, have won only once in 19 games – half the league campaign – and are still not mathematically safe. A point against a Stoke side who have been beaten twice already this season and whose own form has unravelled of late will be enough to guarantee the hosts a third top-flight campaign, and allow them to refocus on Wembley on 21 May. Dominic Fifield"
688,Leicester City,Everton,Fri 6 May 2016 14.48 BST,2015-16,"Last term this was Leicester’s first fixture back after 10 years’ absence and they had only four men with top-flight experience. This time Everton will give the new champions a guard of honour, free beer and pizza vouchers will be given to home fans and the Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli will serenade them as the party goes on. Matty James stands by for a first appearance of the season. Mark Tallentire"
689,Bournemouth,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 6 May 2016 13.15 BST,2015-16,"It is likely to be last on Match of the Day but Eddie Howe will be keen for Bournemouth to put on a performance in their final home game of an impressive debut season in the Premier League. So much so, the Bournemouth chairman, Jeff Mostyn, has forewarned supporters not to go on the pitch at the final whistle. Albion travel to the south coast level on points with the home side, who have lost five of their past six matches. Tony Pulis’s side are guilty of indifferent form themselves but salvaged a draw in their last away match at Tottenham and are more than capable of upsetting the mood once more here. Ben Fisher"
690,Swansea City,Liverpool,Fri 29 Apr 2016 18.58 BST,2015-16,"Swansea’s form has dipped on their travels since they secured Premier League safety but they remain tough hosts, having won their last three matches at home without conceding. Jürgen Klopp is likely to rotate his team to preserve others for Thursday’s Europa League semi-final second leg. A vibrant performance on Sunday from Daniel Sturridge could force the England striker into the lineup for that game. Paul Doyle"
691,Everton,Bournemouth,Fri 29 Apr 2016 18.36 BST,2015-16,"Everton face Bournemouth under pressure amid reports that fans will stage protests against Roberto Martínez. With several key defenders injured or suspended the chance of them extending their poor defensive record at Goodison is likely. Youngsters Matthew Pennington and Kieran Dowell may be handed their league debuts. Max Gradel could return for Bournemouth whose only win in their past five games came at relegated Aston Villa. Eddie Howe might see the game as an audition to replace Martínez as he is currently third favourite with bookies, behind Manuel Pellegrini and David Moyes, to do so. Graham Searles"
692,Newcastle United,Crystal Palace,Fri 29 Apr 2016 18.17 BST,2015-16,"Alan Pardew returns to the club where mention of his name still polarises opinion, in charge of a Palace side who may have reached the FA Cup final but remain on a shocking league run. They do though possess Yohan Cabaye, and Rafa Benítez will be anxious to stop Tyneside’s one-time favourite midfielder reminding the club what they are missing. Cabaye needs to be kept quiet if Newcastle are to secure the victory they so desperately need. Louise Taylor"
693,Manchester United,Leicester City,Fri 29 Apr 2016 18.00 BST,2015-16,"History beckons for Leicester City as they can clinch the Premier League title with victory against Manchester United. It would be a fairytale ending for Claudio Ranieri’s side who will have to cope without Jamie Vardy again after his suspension was extended. However, United will be looking to spoil the party as they have their own ambitions of securing a top-four finish. Bradley Lobo"
694,Watford,Aston Villa,Fri 29 Apr 2016 17.35 BST,2015-16,Aston Villa’s relegation was the worst kept secret in football until it was mercifully confirmed a couple of weeks ago. The real subplot surrounding this fixture is the future of Quique Sánchez Flores. The Spaniard guided Watford to an FA Cup semi-final and they sit safely in 12th place but just two wins in their past 11 league games has seemingly been a cause for concern for the club’s owners. Bradley Lobo
695,Chelsea,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 29 Apr 2016 17.18 BST,2015-16,"Tottenham’s dreams of a first league title in 55 years may have already been dashed by the time they kick off at Stamford Bridge on Monday. A disappointing draw at home to West Brom put the Premier League trophy on a silver platter for Leicester. If Claudio Ranieri’s side fail to win at Old Trafford, Spurs will need to get three points at the home of the reigning champions. However, Chelsea fans and players have expressed a desire to see their London rivals fail in their title pursuit so the Blues will be fired up for this match. Bradley Lobo"
696,Southampton,Manchester City,Fri 29 Apr 2016 16.56 BST,2015-16,"Manuel Pellegrini faces a dilemma for his side’s trip to Southampton. City are far from certain of a top-four finish in the Premier League and failing that, the only way they can qualify for the Champions League next season is by winning the competition. That involves success against Real Madrid at the Bernabéu in midweek. Therefore, the Chilean is likely to rotate his squad and that might give Southampton extra incentive as they continue to chase a Europa League spot. Bradley Lobo"
697,Stoke City,Sunderland,Fri 29 Apr 2016 16.12 BST,2015-16,"With Sam Allardyce concerned that Crystal Palace are going to experience an FA Cup hangover against Newcastle United, there is increased pressure on Sunderland on Saturday. The good news for them is that Stoke City have lost their past three matches, conceding 12 goals in the process – and Sunderland need to turn draws into wins if they are going to stay up. Jacob Steinberg"
698,West Bromwich Albion,West Ham United,Fri 29 Apr 2016 13.45 BST,2015-16,"Slaven Bilic’s decison to rest players for the FA Cup sixth-round replay against Manchester United earlier this month showed the manager had serious ambitions about finishing in the top four. But a renaissance in fortunes for both Manchester clubs means West Ham must win this afternoon and hope Arsenal lose to stand a chance of reaching the Champions League. At least Bilic has a full squad to choose from for the trip to the Hawthorns, with striker Andy Carroll hoping to build on a run of six goals in his last six games. West Brom’s battling second half display against Spurs on Monday showed Tony Pulis’s side are not on the beach just yet, however. Ed Aarons"
699,Arsenal,Norwich City,Fri 29 Apr 2016 13.17 BST,2015-16,This one means everything for Norwich and a positive result would do wonders in their battle to avoid relegation. Arsène Wenger would simply sign up for some positivity. Although Arsenal have not yet confirmed their top four place – there remains work to be done – the bigger picture at the Emirates takes in the acute fan frustration. Wenger’s defiance and stubbornness are enduring. David Hytner
700,Leicester City,Swansea City,Fri 22 Apr 2016 18.52 BST,2015-16,"While few could deny that the suspension of Jamie Vardy is a significant blow to Leicester’s title aspirations, Claudio Ranieri’s side coped when he went five games without scoring in February and March – they won four and drew one. Swansea, who have nothing to play for and have won away only three times all season, should be pushovers for the hosts but the pressure of leading the pack can have a funny effect – just ask Kevin Keegan. Rich Flower"
701,Everton,Manchester United,Fri 22 Apr 2016 18.38 BST,2015-16,"Everton supporters could be forgiven for feeling a little concerned at the prospect of going into an FA Cup semi-final against the 11-times winners, Manchester United, with no centre-backs available. Suspension and injuries may conspire to leave a gaping hole that even Louis van Gaal’s turgid side can find a way through. But few people thought Everton had a chance in the 1995 final either only for Paul Rideout to prove them wrong. Rich Flower"
702,Sunderland,Arsenal,Fri 22 Apr 2016 18.28 BST,2015-16,"The mutual antipathy between Sam Allardyce and Arsène Wenger may have diminished to the point where it has almost been consigned to history but the pair’s more mellow relationship does not mean they have lost their competitive edge. And especially not when so much is at stake. While a win would enhance Sunderland’s survival chances considerably, Wenger’s need to make certain of Champions League qualification – while keeping those critics calling for his summer-time replacement at bay – should ensure a certain spice. Louise Taylor"
703,Liverpool,Newcastle United,Fri 22 Apr 2016 18.20 BST,2015-16,"Rafael Benítez’s return to Anfield as the interim manager of Chelsea in 2013 was overshadowed somewhat by Luis Suárez’s bite on Branislav Ivanovic. He heads back seeking a favour from his old club in his attempt to keep Newcastle in the Premier League, but Liverpool are not in the form to give one – regardless of what team Jürgen Klopp selects. With Villarreal in the Europa League semi-finals to come next week, Klopp may revert to the much-changed lineup that beat Bournemouth last Sunday. Andy Hunter"
704,Crystal Palace,Watford,Fri 22 Apr 2016 17.56 BST,2015-16,"Sunday’s semi-final features a meeting between sides whose Premier League form has ebbed away alarmingly this calendar year, pitting Quique Sánchez Flores, a manager apparently under pressure, against Alan Pardew, who has overseen one top-flight win in close to half a season. This is a rerun of the 2013 Championship play-off final, and figures from that nerve-jangling occasion remain in each team. Another anxious contest awaits. Dominic Fifield"
705,Tottenham,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 22 Apr 2016 16.49 BST,2015-16,"Tottenham can sense opportunity. They played brilliantly last Monday in their 4-0 win at Stoke, after Leicester had dropped points, and they are hell-bent on letting the leaders know that if the door is left open, they will charge through it. Mauricio Pochettino has banned his players from going to Sunday’s PFA awards dinner, because he will not allow the focus to slip before Monday night. Albion played as though their season was over in defeat at Arsenal on Thursday. David Hytner"
706,Aston Villa,Southampton,Fri 22 Apr 2016 16.23 BST,2015-16,"The departures of David Bernstein and Mervyn King from the board and the suspensions of Gabriel Agbonlahor and Jores Okore made it another dire week for Aston Villa in an already dreadful season. Things are unlikely to improve on Saturday with Southampton needing a win to keep their European hopes alive. Already relegated after nine defeats in a row, the only thing the Villa squad have left to play for is pride – but will they show any? Rich Flower"
707,Manchester City,Stoke City,Fri 22 Apr 2016 15.27 BST,2015-16,"As is the tale of their season, Manchester City were flying on arrival at Newcastle United on Wednesday night but stumbled surprisingly and could only draw against the relegation-threatened side. Now Stoke City must be beaten or Manchester United could overhaul Manuel Pellegrini’s side in the chase for a Champions League place. The visitors will need no reminding of how they dismantled City 2-0 in early December so this will be an intriguing watch. Jamie Jackson"
708,Bournemouth,Chelsea,Fri 22 Apr 2016 15.14 BST,2015-16,"Bournemouth’s victory over Chelsea in December was the penultimate league match of José Mourinho’s second tenure at Stamford Bridge and, when Glenn Murray struck late on, it ensured the champions remained mired in the bottom reaches of the table. Now Chelsea are three points clear of Eddie Howe’s side as the campaign draws to a close, but it is clear which club has enjoyed the better season. James Riach"
709,Norwich City,Sunderland,Fri 15 Apr 2016 18.32 BST,2015-16,"This is the type of game the phrase six-pointer was created for but the Friendship Trophy is more important for Sunderland, who would pull within a point of Norwich with victory. A win for Alex Neil’s team will give them at least a six-point cushion from the relegation zone – possibly more depending on events at St James’ Park – with four games to go. Newcastle, for once, will be hoping their local rivals win. Alan Smith"
710,Leicester City,West Ham United,Fri 15 Apr 2016 18.03 BST,2015-16,"Five games to go. Leicester can afford to slip up in two of them and still win their first title but on current form it looks like they might secure the trophy with time to spare. Victory against West Ham, likely still hurting from their FA Cup exit to Manchester United in midweek, would see Claudio Ranieri’s team 10 points clear of Tottenham before the Londoners play Stoke on Monday. This fixture last season was the moment Leicester started their recovery, winning 2-1. Alan Smith"
711,Newcastle United,Swansea City,Fri 15 Apr 2016 17.38 BST,2015-16,"Rafael Benítez celebrates his 56th birthday on Saturday but he will only be smiling if he secures his first win as manager of Newcastle United. Should Benitez’s players suffer another stumble survival will, realistically, be near impossible so the Spaniard could do with a strong performance from Jonjo Shelvey against his former employers. He must also cope without Daryl Janmaat, his Holland right back, who has undergone hand surgery after punching a dressing room wall in frustration during last Saturday’s defeat at frustration. Tynesiders can only pray Swansea’s Gylfi Sigurdsson’s recent stellar form deserts him. Louise Taylor"
712,Chelsea,Manchester City,Fri 15 Apr 2016 17.04 BST,2015-16,"Eyebrows would have been raised if you said these two would be long ruled out of title contention by mid-April before this most unpredictable of seasons began, but this will at least be a tad more competitive than City’s last visit to Stamford Bridge, where Manuel Pellegrini’s protest team were skewered 5-1 in the FA Cup. They could do with a win to help their top-four case. Alan Smith"
713,Stoke City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 15 Apr 2016 16.39 BST,2015-16,"By kick-off at the Britannia on Monday evening, Tottenham could be 10 points behind Leicester with five games to play. They should, however, have enough to beat Stoke, who remain saddled with selection problems in defence and have won only once in their last five outings. Jakob Haugaard has been unconvincing in goal so Stoke’s Irish veteran Shay Given could be brought in. Alan Smith"

715,Arsenal,Crystal Palace,Fri 15 Apr 2016 14.51 BST,2015-16,"Arsenal have reached the point where they need a near-miracle for a title win and it feels like the imperative now is to button down a Champions League finish and, ideally, reel in Tottenham Hotspur. Their run-in looks favourable and they do have a cushion over fifth-placed Manchester United. Arsène Wenger merely wants victories over teams that Arsenal should be beating, and prayers to be answered. Crystal Palace have an FA Cup semi-final next Sunday. Has this been mentioned at all?

Albion have the worst shots-on-target average in the country, while Watford are on a stinking run of form (losing four of their last five) and might have an eye on next weekend’s FA Cup semi-final. The reverse fixture, predictably, ended scoreless. Alan Smith"
717,Bournemouth,Liverpool,Fri 15 Apr 2016 13.45 BST,2015-16,"How much energy will Liverpool have after Thursday night’s heroic comeback against Borussia Dortmund? A trip to face Eddie Howe’s high-energy Bournemouth, who could remarkably finish in the top half in their debut top-flight season, is sure to be testing. The hosts will be without influential midfielder Harry Arter, though, who has an ankle injury that might rule him out of Euro 2016. Alan Smith"
718,Everton,Southampton,Fri 15 Apr 2016 12.36 BST,2015-16,"Europe remains an incentive for Ronald Koeman with his team just two points off qualification for the Europa League but for Roberto Martínez the pressure is much closer to home. Eight home league defeats are the principal reason for mounting criticism of the Everton manager, who has a Merseyside derby and FA Cup semi-final next week and may protect such leading players as Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley from minor knocks as a consequence. Andy Hunter"
719,Sunderland,Leicester City,Fri 8 Apr 2016 18.10 BST,2015-16,"Jan Kirchhoff and Yann M’Vila take on N’Golo Kanté and Danny Drinkwater in an intriguing meeting between two formidably strong central midfield departments as two teams with broadly similar playing philosophies lock horns. Jermain Defoe will hope to upstage Jamie Vardy on a day when Sunderland aim to prove they are not quite as bad as their position, third bottom in the table, suggests. Sam Allardyce’s problem is that Leicester will want to remind everyone – Tottenham particularly – why they would make worthy champions. Louise Taylor"
720,Southampton,Newcastle United,Fri 8 Apr 2016 17.52 BST,2015-16,"The Rafa Benítez effect has yet to take hold at Newcastle and the manager and club are running out of time and matches. If they are to make a late dash out of the relegation zone, they could do with getting their first away point – or three – of the year at St Mary’s. Aleksandar Mitrovic made a strong case for a starting spot, scoring twice at Norwich last week after coming off the bench, but Southampton’s central defenders are capable of stifling the Serb’s aerial ability and the hosts will fancy their chances of winning to reassert their push for European qualification. Paul Doyle"
721,Liverpool,Stoke City,Fri 8 Apr 2016 17.28 BST,2015-16,"Jürgen Klopp’s team are eyeing European qualification through the glorified route of winning the Europa League but both sides will be looking to enhance their claims via the Premier League at Anfield. Liverpool and Stoke City have met three times this season with the away team winning 1-0 on each occasion, although disappointingly for Mark Hughes that was not enough to take his side into the Capital One Cup final on their last visit to Anfield. Liverpool’s options are stretched in central midfield with Jordan Henderson injured and Emre Can commencing a two-match suspension. Andy Hunter"
722,Tottenham Hotspur,Manchester United,Fri 8 Apr 2016 17.01 BST,2015-16,"If the title is not going to end up with Claudio Ranieri and Leicester, Tottenham need to win here.

724,Crystal Palace,Norwich City,Fri 8 Apr 2016 16.17 BST,2015-16,"For most clubs tantalisingly in touch of safety, successive home games against Norwich City and Everton would represent an opportunity. After all, Alex Neil’s side are one of the few teams below Crystal Palace, while Everton’s focus is purely on an FA Cup semi-final to come. Yet Alan Pardew’s side have lost their last six matches at Selhurst Park and Norwich are in their best form of the season and threatening to break free of the condemned. Pardew has called for a raucous atmosphere but this pocket of south London may be gripped by nerves. Dominic Fifield"
725,West Ham United,Arsenal,Fri 8 Apr 2016 15.34 BST,2015-16,"West Ham began their season with a 2-0 victory at the Emirates Stadium and their chances of finishing in the top four could rest on completing their first league double over Arsenal since the 2006-07 season.

This bounce may be required to dismantle a Tony Pulis side that could feature a four-man defence of centre-backs, as is the manager’s penchant. This was what Manchester United faced when they lost at The Hawthorns last month and, as Louis van Gaal’s side are at Tottenham Hotspur on Sunday, here is a chance to open up a four-point lead over United in the race for a Champions League berth.

727,Swansea City,Chelsea,Fri 8 Apr 2016 14.45 BST,2015-16,"Chelsea have never drawn blank against Swansea in the Premier League and combined with the fact that Guus Hiddink is yet to lose a league game since returning, the omens are not brilliant for Francesco Guidolin. However, Gylfi Sigurdsson’s three goals in his last four games have lifted Swansea from imminent danger and the Icelander’s semblance of his former brilliance could upset the odds. Graham Searles"
728,Aston Villa,Bournemouth,Fri 8 Apr 2016 14.17 BST,2015-16,"It may seem incredible but Aston Villa are bidding to complete a league double over Bournemouth, after securing their only away win against Eddie Howe’s side on the opening day of the season. Since then Villa have crumbled, sacking Tim Sherwood and Rémi Garde. All hopes of avoiding relegation are more mathematical than plausible now and the drop could be confirmed on Saturday. Graham Searles"
729,Arsenal,Watford,Fri 1 Apr 2016 18.21 BST,2015-16,"Watford are enjoying a great season under Quique Sánchez Flores, but with one point from their last four league games they still have to be careful. Arsenal need victory to stay in the top four – and to keep any possible title hopes alive. These sides met at the Emirates only three weeks ago in the FA Cup, when Watford worked incredibly hard to knock out an Arsenal side that looked far too complacent on the day. Arthur Renard"
730,Norwich City,Newcastle United,Fri 1 Apr 2016 17.53 BST,2015-16,Defeat would leave both of these sides even deeper in relegation trouble so the first test at Carrow Road will be to conquer nerves. That will be particularly true for the goalkeeper – probably Karl Darlow – drafted into the Newcastle line-up to replace the injured Rob Elliot. None of Norwich’s strikers have scored regularly this season but whichever of them is deployed by Alex Neil is sure to be instructed to put as much pressure as possible on the inexperienced stand-in. Paul Doyle
731,Manchester United,Everton,Fri 1 Apr 2016 17.29 BST,2015-16,"After the exhilaration of the 1-0 derby win at Manchester City, Manchester United have eight league matches to move up from sixth to fourth place and thus qualify for the Champions League. Everton were downed 3-0 at Goodison Park in October’s reverse fixture and Louis van Gaal said it was a complete display. How Van Gaal would love a repeat over a Roberto Martínez side whose 38 points is a poor yield given their array of stellar talents, led by Romelu Lukaku and Ross Barkley. Jamie Jackson"
732,Bournemouth,Manchester City,Fri 1 Apr 2016 16.58 BST,2015-16,"Manuel Pellegrini’s Manchester City travel to the south coast in search of their first win in four matches. After losing to Manchester United before the international break, City’s hopes of securing a top-four finish suddenly look precarious, with in-form West Ham United breathing down their necks. Bournemouth travelled to Dubai for a five-day training camp over the international break and Eddie Howe is keen for the home side to perform after a 5-1 defeat at the Etihad in October. “It’s not one we just want to host and put on a show for them, we want to give them a really good game,” said Howe. Ben Fisher"
733,Stoke City,Swansea City,Fri 1 Apr 2016 16.22 BST,2015-16,"Stoke City and Swansea City have been playing well of late and both need another victory, for different reasons. The Swans need the points to get safe from relegation while Stoke are still hoping for Europa League qualification. In their last four meetings at the Britannia Stadium, Stoke have won three. Despite losing Jack Butland for the season, Mark Hughes will be hoping Marko Arnautovic, a scorer in their past three home games, can be the difference again. Arthur Renard"
734,Leicester City,Southampton,Fri 1 Apr 2016 16.01 BST,2015-16,"Leicester City will hope a fourth successive win on Sunday will serve to extend their advantage at the top of the table from its current five points. Certainly, even a home game against a fine Southampton side will feel like an opportunity and, for once, the hosts must perform after Tottenham Hotspur’s daunting trip to Anfield. The likes of Jamie Vardy, Danny Drinkwater and N’Golo Kanté will have returned to the King Power Stadium buoyed by their impact over the international break. A repeat of Riyad Mahrez’s brace last May would do the home side very well indeed. Dominic Fifield"
735,Liverpool,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 1 Apr 2016 15.21 BST,2015-16,"Liverpool have not cast off their maddening inconsistency, as confirmed inside 90 minutes at Southampton, but a trip to Anfield represents a fundamental test of Tottenham’s title credentials regardless. The visitors have won only one of their last 21 league trips to Liverpool and have collected nine points from the last 63 available at Anfield. But with Harry Kane one goal short of a Premier League record for Spurs and Dele Alli confronting the club that neglected to sign him, Mauricio Pochettino has the talent to make a significant statement of intent. Andy Hunter"
736,Sunderland,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 1 Apr 2016 14.41 BST,2015-16,"A run of 17 games without a clean sheet has undermined the improvements implemented by Sam Allardyce at Sunderland. “It means we need to score twice to stand a chance of winning,” said Allardyce who will aim to put such defensive shortcomings right at the expense of his friend Tony Pulis in what threatens to prove a less than expansive contest. While West Brom enjoy the luxury of mid-table security, anything less than victory will escalate Wearside relegation concerns. Louise Taylor"
737,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Fri 1 Apr 2016 14.19 BST,2015-16,"Does anyone still believe Aston Villa are capable of producing a miracle? No. They are 12 points adrift of safety with seven games to go but have long looked resigned to relegation. It makes this early kick-off something of a nothing game. Chelsea have a nine-point gap to sixth, perhaps making it an ideal time for Guus Hiddink to give a portion of the club’s youngsters some minutes. Alan Smith"
738,West Ham United,Crystal Palace,Fri 1 Apr 2016 12.43 BST,2015-16,"Alan Pardew returns to a former club in desperate need of points. Crystal Palace were fifth on New Year’s Eve but 13 games without a league win have transformed them into unlikely relegation candidates. Yet although they have won each of their past two visits to Upton Park, Palace are sure to find it tough against Slaven Bilic’s West Ham United, who have their eyes on the Champions League. Jacob Steinberg"
739,Watford,Stoke City,Fri 18 Mar 2016 18.18 GMT,2015-16,"Watford capped a great season back in the top flight last weekend, as they secured their passage into the FA Cup semi-finals against Arsenal. Quique Sánchez Flores’s side will now look to turn around their league form having only won one of their last six. Stoke City travel to Vicarage Road having lost for the first time in five games last week against Southampton and Mark Hughes will know returning to winnings ways will be tough against Watford’s staunch defence. Simon Hahn"
740,West Bromwich Albion,Norwich City,Fri 18 Mar 2016 18.00 GMT,2015-16,"West Bromwich Albion are one of the form teams in the Premier League having picked up 10 points from their past four games including a 1-0 win over Man United two weeks ago. The run has moved them away from danger at the bottom, whereas Norwich City are still deep in trouble. Despite an improved showing against Manchester City last week, Alex Neil’s side have not won since 2 January and are still among the relegation favourites. Simon Hahn"
741,Swansea City,Aston Villa,Fri 18 Mar 2016 17.53 GMT,2015-16,"It is easy to see why Francesco Guidolin has described this fixture as the “most important game of the season” for Swansea City. Another three points will take the Welsh club to 36 and surely put any lingering relegation fears to bed. André Ayew is sidelined with an ankle injury but Gylfi Sigurdsson is in fine form and Swansea will be confident of picking up a third win in four matches. As for Aston Villa, they have lost their last five and need a minor miracle. Stuart James"
742,Newcastle United,Sunderland,Fri 18 Mar 2016 17.14 GMT,2015-16,"Possibly the most important north-east derby to date features two managers with a history of conflict effectively on missions to relegate each other. If the Big Sam-Rafa technical subplot promises edginess, Rafael Benítez is more concerned with marking his first home game in charge of Newcastle by ending Sunderland’s run of six straight derby wins. By peculiar coincidence, four of those victories saw Sunderland under the charge of a new manager presiding over his second game after losing the first. Can Benítez emulate Paolo Di Canio, Gus Poyet, Dick Advocaat and Allardyce? Louise Taylor"
743,Tottenham Hotspur,Bournemouth,Fri 18 Mar 2016 16.19 GMT,2015-16,"Tottenham Hotspur can now focus solely on their pursuit of a first league title in 55 years with their involvement in Europe curtailed in midweek, though Bournemouth will hardly be pushovers at White Hart Lane. Eddie Howe’s side are mid-table, virtually safe, unbeaten away from home in 2016 and have won their last three matches. The hosts will restore Harry Kane, Christian Eriksen, Mousa Dembélé and their full-back pairing and hope they hit the ground running. Last Sunday’s win at Villa Park has eased a few nerves, but now is the time for Mauricio Pochettino’s side to generate real momentum. Dominic Fifield"
744,Everton,Arsenal,Fri 18 Mar 2016 15.41 GMT,2015-16,"It might be cynical to suggest Arsenal have commenced their annual reverse into fourth place but, despite Roberto Martínez’s claims that his opponents remain strong title contenders, a run of one win in eight games in all competitions has presented an all too familiar problem for Arsène Wenger. At least they will not be facing Messi, Suárez, Neymar and co when they arrive at Everton, who have won only one of the past 17 league meetings between the sides and lost seven times already at home in the Premier League this season. Andy Hunter"
745,Crystal Palace,Leicester City,Fri 18 Mar 2016 15.12 GMT,2015-16,"Selhurst Park has been a graveyard for prospective Premier League champions in the past and despite Palace’s failure to record a league win so far in 2016, Leicester City will be wary of their trip to south London. Alan Pardew’s side have belied their struggles to reach the FA Cup semi-finals for the first time in 21 years and, with Yannick Bolasie back on form, Palace could be a potential banana skin for the Foxes. Claudio Ranieri had a sausage, of all things, named after him this week by a local butcher but the Leicester manager knows this is no time to take anything for granted. Ed Aarons"
746,Chelsea,West Ham United,Fri 18 Mar 2016 15.00 GMT,2015-16,"Slaven Bilic has warned his players not to take Chelsea lightly, even though the champions seemingly have nothing to play for after going out of the Champions League and the FA Cup. Chelsea are nine points behind West Ham United, who are two points off the top four, and have a selection headache with Diego Costa suspended. Nonetheless, Bilic is wary of their threat and West Ham will need to be at their best to win at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 2002. Jacob Steinberg"
747,Manchester City,Manchester United,Fri 18 Mar 2016 14.50 GMT,2015-16,"Manchester City can all but kill off Manchester United’s Champions League qualification hopes by winning the 171st derby. This would also boost their bid to ensure a top-four finish and overhaul the faltering Arsenal, who are third. After United’s exit from the Europa League at Liverpool’s hands, Louis van Gaal could do without a defeat and as this is the story of his season, expect little to change regarding his employment. Jamie Jackson"
748,Southampton,Liverpool,Fri 18 Mar 2016 14.04 GMT,2015-16,"A repeat of the 6-1 victory that Liverpool enjoyed at St Mary’s in the Capital One Cup in December would be welcome for Jürgen Klopp’s team, who remain within striking distance of the top four. But Southampton have tightened up since then and, with Graziano Pellè back on the goal trail and Sadio Mané having had his red card rescinded, they have the firepower to pursue their own European ambitions. All is set for a high-stakes, high-quality duel. Paul Doyle"
749,Everton,Chelsea,Fri 11 Mar 2016 18.29 GMT,2015-16,"Everton will be keen to overcome the significant challenge of Chelsea’s visit to Goodison Park, in order to ease the pain of faltering in the League Cup semi-finals. Roberto Martínez lifted the FA Cup back in 2013 so there are reasons to be confident. However his side’s poor home form is a worry. Guus Hiddink knows Chelsea have the quality, if they choose to use it, to earn a semi-final berth of their own. Graham Searles"
750,Stoke City,Southampton,Fri 11 Mar 2016 18.10 GMT,2015-16,"Stoke, who have taken 10 points from their past four matches and after securing an impressive 1-1 draw with Chelsea last time out, appear to be in a rich vein of form. So Mark Hughes will welcome Southampton to the Britannia as he endeavours to better last season’s record 54-point haul. Ronald Koeman can only hope his defence remains resolute and that Graziano Pellè finally finds the net once more as the Italian’s goal drought stretches back to the beginning of November. Graham Searles"
751,Manchester United,West Ham United,Fri 11 Mar 2016 17.31 GMT,2015-16,"In this season of boom and bust, Louis van Gaal will face a particularly torrid walk from dugout to changing room along the Old Trafford touchline should Manchester United suffer a third consecutive defeat, to West Ham United. It would also mean the wait for a 12th triumph in the Cup will extend to a 13th year. Slaven Bilic’s side have won their past four matches and there will be no surprise if this becomes five. Jamie Jackson"
752,Leicester City,Newcastle United,Fri 11 Mar 2016 17.04 GMT,2015-16,"Rafa Benítez has the unenviable task of taking charge of Newcastle United against league leaders, Leicester City. That said, expectations will be low on Tyneside, so an unlikely positive result could prove hugely beneficial to Newcastle’s hopes of staying in the Premier League. Claudio Ranieri, meanwhile, will see victory as a must as their closest threat, Tottenham, should earn three points against Aston Villa. Graham Searles"
753,Arsenal,Watford,Fri 11 Mar 2016 16.40 GMT,2015-16,"Arsenal fans will be relieved that Per Mertesacker and Gabriel Paulista will start, after both central defenders were taken off injured against Hull City on Tuesday. With hope in the Champions League all but lost, the FA Cup looks like Arsenal’s strongest chance of silverware. Watford, meanwhile, should be closely studying the footage of Swansea’s victory at the Emirates, in order to plot safe passage into the semi-finals. Graham Searles"
754,Aston Villa,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 11 Mar 2016 14.53 GMT,2015-16,"Mauricio Pochettino made it clear with his weakened team selection in Thursday’s 3-0 defeat against Borussia Dortmund that the Premier League is his priority this season. Aston Villa should, on the face of it, be obliging opponents for Spurs and it is tempting to wonder if Pochettino could have rested players for this fixture, against the Premier League’s bottom club, and picked a stronger side in Dortmund. Either way Spurs need to get back on track after winning only two of their last seven in all competitions. Stuart James"
755,Norwich City,Manchester City,Fri 11 Mar 2016 14.03 GMT,2015-16,"It seems implausible that, despite taking one point from their past nine games, Norwich City are only a win from 17th place. Victory cannot be delayed much longer though and Alex Neil’s side might not wish to dwell on the fact that their woeful league run was prefaced, back in January, by a 3-0 FA Cup defeat at Carrow Road to Manchester City. Victory for the away side would apply a degree of pressure on the title chasers above them, and this looks like a game neither team can really afford to lose. Nick Ames"
756,Bournemouth,Swansea City,Fri 11 Mar 2016 12.50 GMT,2015-16,"Only a few weeks ago, this match would have felt hugely important in the race for Premier League survival. It still might be but Bournemouth have taken an impressive haul of seven points from their last three matches while Swansea have won their last two. Swansea will still be without head coach Francesco Guidolin, who continues to recover from a chest infection. First-team coach Alan Curtis will again deputise in the dugout. Ben Fisher"
757,Newcastle United,Bournemouth,Fri 4 Mar 2016 18.19 GMT,2015-16,"There are many who feel the endgame is under way for Steve McClaren at Newcastle. Some suspect this may be his last stand as manager but he remains optimistic he can confound the doubters by leading his team out of the bottom three. Bournemouth, though, will be anxious to exert revenge for a slightly flukey Newcastle win on the south coast earlier in the season. Fabricio Coloccini is still injured, so Jonjo Shelvey continues as the home captain with his manager hoping the England midfielder can bring much needed “edge” to the role. Louise Taylor"
758,Swansea City,Norwich City,Fri 4 Mar 2016 17.54 GMT,2015-16,"After fielding a weakened side against Arsenal, which showed Swansea City were focusing on hosting Norwich City, they will be delighted with pulling off a huge upset at the Emirates on Wednesday. Francesco Guidolin will not be present on the touchline again but his side should be very confident they can inflict another defeat on struggling Norwich. Alex Neil needs three points urgently to allay fears of Championship football next season. Graham Searles"
759,Manchester City,Aston Villa,Fri 4 Mar 2016 17.31 GMT,2015-16,"Manchester City have the perfect opportunity to bounce back from their rather embarrassing 3-0 defeat to Liverpool on Wednesday. If Manuel Pellegrini cannot rouse City to beat Aston Villa then hopes of winning the title will surely be all but lost. Rémi Garde, meanwhile, could be forgiven for dreading his side’s visit to the Etihad and the proposition of being cut further adrift at the foot of the table. Graham Searles"
760,West Bromwich Albion,Manchester United,Fri 4 Mar 2016 17.04 GMT,2015-16,"Given this season of high unpredictability Manchester United still have an outside chance of claiming the title. They are 10 points behind Leicester City as West Bromwich Albion welcome them, having won their past three matches. Tony Pulis’s side held Claudio Ranieri’s leaders to a draw on Tuesday and will be a tough proposition for Louis van Gaal’s side. This may end in a draw. Jamie Jackson"
761,Everton,West Ham United,Fri 4 Mar 2016 16.35 GMT,2015-16,"Slaven Bilic admitted on Friday that a top-four finish for his West Ham side “is realistic now. We are one point behind with 10 games to go so we have a chance”. Everton, eight points further back, have no such hope and it will take a flourish over the final few months for this not to be regarded as a season of underachievement. The new investment at Goodison brings extra pressure. John Ashdown"
762,Crystal Palace,Liverpool,Fri 4 Mar 2016 16.25 GMT,2015-16,"Victory over Manchester City in midweek gave Jürgen Klopp a much-needed boost after defeat in the Capital One Cup final, but inconsistency has stalked his Liverpool side thus far. They have not beaten Palace in the league at Selhurst since 1997 but the Eagles are in freefall. Had the Premier League season begun on New Year’s Day Alan Pardew’s side would be bottom of the table. John Ashdown"
763,Watford,Leicester City,Fri 4 Mar 2016 15.19 GMT,2015-16,"West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster denied Leicester maximum points in midweek, and Watford’s Heurelho Gomes will be keen to keep Claudio Ranieri’s side at bay too, as he made a costly mistake to gift Leicester with victory at the King Power Stadium in November. The Brazilian goalkeeper will have to excel if the hosts are to disrupt Leicester’s progress towards the title, especially if Odion Ighalo’s six-game goal drought continues. Paul Doyle"
764,Tottenham Hotspur,Arsenal,Fri 4 Mar 2016 14.51 GMT,2015-16,"This is a biggie. In fact, this is the biggest north London derby in recent memory. As Arsène Wenger remarked, never before in his 19 and a half years at Arsenal has this showdown stood to shape the title race. Tottenham slipped up at West Ham in midweek but their belief is strong and they are favourites. Arsenal’s form has deserted them and another defeat does not bear thinking about for Wenger. David Hytner"
765,Chelsea,Stoke City,Fri 4 Mar 2016 14.27 GMT,2015-16,"The last time these sides met Chelsea were in crisis and their manager was banned from the stadium. How times change. The London club are now in excellent form and the man in charge, Guus Hiddink, can do no wrong. Stoke will prove a stern test, however, and should sense they can win at Stamford Bridge for the first time since 1974, especially as John Terry remains out injured. Sachin Nakrani"
766,Southampton,Sunderland,Fri 4 Mar 2016 14.09 GMT,2015-16,"Hovering just above the relegation zone with just one win in seven, the omens don’t bode well for Sunderland as they make the long trip to Southampton, where they were thrashed 8-0 last season. They have won just two games on the road in this campaign and will be without midfield enforcer Lee Cattermole through a concussion. Ronald Koeman will miss his hamstrung striker Charlie Austin, while Shane Long must also sit this one out. Barry Glendenning"
767,Watford,Bournemouth,Fri 26 Feb 2016 18.32 GMT,2015-16,"Watford and Bournemouth both sit above the relegation places, a pleasing sight for a promoted manager. Quique Sánchez Flores will be the happier of the two, though, as his side close in on securing top-flight status – if they win on Saturday, they will have 39 points. Meanwhile, Eddie Howe needs to spark Bournemouth into life after three successive defeats, the most recent in the FA Cup. Graham Searles"
768,West Ham United,Sunderland,Fri 26 Feb 2016 18.15 GMT,2015-16,"Sam Allardyce’s return to Upton Park provides the human interest but the warmth of reception he receives will not change the stakes being fought for. West Ham have a habit of dropping points when the Champions League places move into view but victory here might exert some pressure on those above; Allardyce’s Sunderland, on the other hand can take encouragement from an improved run of February performances and the manager’s face will be a picture if his side have earned three vital points to aid their relegation fight. Nick Ames"
769,Stoke City,Aston Villa,Fri 26 Feb 2016 17.58 GMT,2015-16,"Hopes that Aston Villa may have belatedly been stirring to fight relegation seem to have been snuffed out by the 6-0 drubbing by Liverpool a fortnight ago. Rémi Garde has Rudy Gestede and Gabriel Agbonlahor fit again but an ailing defence will be tested by a Stoke side that, bolstered by new arrival Giannelli Imbula, looked to have recovered their potency in the win at Bournemouth. Tom Davies"
770,Manchester United,Arsenal,Fri 26 Feb 2016 17.01 GMT,2015-16,"Manchester United have the chance to win three consecutive games for the first time since November by beating Arsenal. The feat would mark an excellent seven days for Louis van Gaal. Arsène Wenger’s side have lost and drawn their past two matches but neither of these were in the league, and given Arsenal are two points behind Leicester City after beating them before the FA Cup round, victory is necessary to continue their push for title glory. Jamie Jackson"
771,West Bromwich Albion,Crystal Palace,Fri 26 Feb 2016 14.56 GMT,2015-16,"Separated by goal difference, neither are safe from a relegation fight just yet. West Bromwich Albion’s restorative win at Everton before the FA Cup shenanigans at Reading was a big boost for Tony Pulis’s team, while Palace’s league form has been diabolical. They have not won since the turn of the year, losing six of their last nine. But can they build on their Cup win at Tottenham? Alan Smith"
772,Southampton,Chelsea,Fri 26 Feb 2016 14.19 GMT,2015-16,"Southampton have not conceded a goal in nine hours and 14 minutes of football, a daunting statistic for any side to tackle. However, if Chelsea can build on their impressive Cup demolition of Manchester City last Sunday then Guus Hiddink should expect a positive outcome. Ronald Koeman, meanwhile, will believe his compatriot is vulnerable and St Mary’s can witness a fifth straight home win. Graham Searles"
773,Leicester City,Norwich City,Fri 26 Feb 2016 13.45 GMT,2015-16,Leicester City return to action refreshed after their late defeat at the hands of Arsenal and Claudio Ranieri will relish the prospect of hosting Norwich. Alex Neil’s side have conceded 18 and taken just one point from their past six games. Expecting victory should always be avoided but Ranieri can be sure Riyad Mahrez and Jamie Vardy have the quality to maintain Leicester’s two-point advantage at the top. Graham Searles
774,Tottenham Hotspur,Swansea City,Fri 26 Feb 2016 13.17 GMT,2015-16,"Francesco Guidolin has been under the weather during the week and it is tempting, although incorrect, to link the Swansea City manager’s queasiness to this fixture. Tottenham slipped up last weekend in the FA Cup against Crystal Palace but they are in a rare grove while Swansea have found goals hard to come by and they remain perched above the relegation places. Under Guidolin, they have stabilised but title-chasing Tottenham are determined to make no mistakes. David Hytner"
775,Blackburn Rovers,West Ham United,Fri 19 Feb 2016 18.47 GMT,2015-16,"With Dimitri Payet starting for West Ham it is very difficult seeing Blackburn be able to have any riposte to the French international’s technical ability. However, Paul Lambert ended Blackburn’s nine-game wait for a Championship win with an impressive victory over Fulham on Tuesday night and will be confident his side can achieve a shock victory to advance into the quarter-finals. Graham Searles"
776,Shrewsbury Town,Manchester United,Fri 19 Feb 2016 18.28 GMT,2015-16,"God help you, Louis, if you lose this one. Shrewsbury Town, embroiled in a relegation battle in League One, welcome the crisis club that is Manchester United to Shropshire for a game that would surely mark the end of Van Gaal’s tenure if he suffers another defeat. United’s injury list continues to grow with the addition of David de Gea. James Wallace is ruled out for Shrewsbury. Stuart James"
777,Chelsea,Manchester City,Fri 19 Feb 2016 18.12 GMT,2015-16,"Damaging back-to-back Premier League defeats, injuries and the schlep to Dynamo Kyiv for Wednesday’s Champions League game have weighed on Manuel Pellegrini before the FA Cup fifth round’s biggest tie. The Manchester City manager has said he will prioritise Kyiv and Stamford Bridge could be a chance for some of his younger players. Chelsea’s focus is rather more narrow and Guus Hiddink will go all-in for a second FA Cup in two attempts. David Hytner"
778,Tottenham Hotspur,Crystal Palace,Fri 19 Feb 2016 16.40 GMT,2015-16,"Emmanuel Adebayor will inevitably be the focus of attention as he attempts to oust from the FA Cup the team that continues to pay a decent percentage of his wages, and with the home defence weakened by the absence of Hugo Lloris and Jan Vertonghen. Tottenham coped well without them at Fiorentina on Thursday, when they drew 1-1 in the first leg of their Europa League last-16 tie. Simon Burnton"
779,Reading,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 19 Feb 2016 16.08 GMT,2015-16,"Reading have won only one of their past nine league games but should prove tricky opposition for West Brom, who ended their own poor run in typical Tony Pulis style against Everton last Saturday. Reading, however, have beaten Albion in their last three ties in the Cup and Brian McDermott will hope Matej Vydra can pass a late fitness test to lead the charge for the quarter-finals. Graham Searles"
780,Arsenal,Hull City,Fri 19 Feb 2016 15.22 GMT,2015-16,Arsenal could start seeing Hull City as a good luck charm. Arsène Wenger’s side beat Hull in the final in 2014 and in the third round last year on the way to lifting the trophy in the past two seasons. Steve Bruce meanwhile will be hopeful that it will be third time lucky and Hull can finally begin to banish the memory of letting a commanding lead in the final slip two years ago. Graham Searles
781,Watford,Leeds Utd,Fri 19 Feb 2016 14.40 GMT,2015-16,"Watford are sitting comfortably in the Premier League and with Leeds struggling in the division below, they must fancy their chances of extending their run in the Cup to the quarter-finals. Quique Sánchez Flores watched Leeds live in the Champions League semi-finals 15 years ago. “I remember perfectly how important this team was in this period,” he recalls, but Steve Evans’ side have not found consistency this year. James Riach"
782,Bournemouth,Everton,Fri 19 Feb 2016 13.07 GMT,2015-16,"Bournemouth have only reached the quarter-finals once but Everton, whose Premier League season risks petering out, may be more attracted to the idea of cup success. John Stones could return to the visitors’ side after injury and Joel Robles will remain in goal. The home manager, Eddie Howe, says he will make several changes to his relegation-battling team and both clubs would doubtless prefer to avoid a repeat of their dramatic but nerve-wracking 3-3 draw in November. Nick Ames"
783,Crystal Palace,Watford,Fri 12 Feb 2016 18.13 GMT,2015-16,"At the end of December, these two teams looked as if they may be in contention for an unlikely push for Europe. But while Palace ended a run of five successive defeats last week with a point at Swansea, Watford have also stuttered having picked up only four points from their last six matches. Both sides will be therefore be desperate for a victory, although Palace’s need is probably greater. They will have to do it without Yannick Bolasie, who is due to return next week, while Watford will hope Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney can rediscover their scoring touches having failed to find the net in four of their last five matches. Ed Aarons"
784,Norwich City,West Ham United,Fri 12 Feb 2016 17.56 GMT,2015-16,"Relegation is looking an increasingly likely prospect for Alex Neil’s Norwich. They take on an upwardly mobile West Ham side that will inevitably be buoyed by their dramatic FA Cup victory over Liverpool in midweek. To add to Norwich’s frustrations, midfielder Alex Tettey is suspended. However, West Ham have issues of their own to deal with as Cheikhou Kouyaté, Winston Reid and Joey O’Brien all miss out. The Norwich winger Matt Jarvis will hope for an opportunity to impress against his former side, with Neil’s side in need of attacking inspiration. Jeorge Bird"
785,Sunderland,Manchester United,Fri 12 Feb 2016 17.22 GMT,2015-16,"If Louis van Gaal thinks he has got problems at Manchester United he should try swapping places with Sunderland’s Sam Allardyce. As if a relegation struggle was not bad enough, the Wearside club sacked Adam Johnson, their former England winger on Thursday night. Allardyce and Van Gaal failed to see eye to eye last season when the then West Ham manager left the Dutchman incensed after accusing Manchester United of “throwing long balls into the box” to secure a late 1-1 draw at Upton Park. Louise Taylor"
786,Chelsea,Newcastle United,Fri 12 Feb 2016 16.54 GMT,2015-16,"Guus Hiddink’s pursuit of a first home win in the Premier League since returning to Chelsea as interim manager will continue against Newcastle, a team who have lost their last five away games in all competitions stretching back two months. Yet the visitors have bolstered their ranks and will pose a different kind of threat at Stamford Bridge, where Chelsea forever seem to be striving to salvage games. Unbeaten in 11, the hosts still need a win to look convincing before their midweek Champions League duel with Paris Saint-Germain. Dominic Fifield"
787,Manchester City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 12 Feb 2016 16.41 GMT,2015-16,"A defeat for Manchester City by Tottenham Hotspur and victory for Leicester City at Arsenal earlier in the day would put Manuel Pellegrini’s side nine points behind the Foxes. This might not kill their title hopes but would certainly leave them moribund, so the solution is simple, though difficult to achieve: beat Mauricio Pochettino’s men. City’s ambitions should be boosted by Vincent Kompany’s return following a long-standing calf injury. Jamie Jackson"
788,Arsenal,Leicester City,Fri 12 Feb 2016 16.31 GMT,2015-16,"Can Le Professeur outsmart the self-titled Thinkerman again? Maybe, after all Arsène Wenger is the only manager so far to make Leicester look like the side that were bottom for much of last season. Arsenal, therefore, should be confident they can repeat the display and cut Leicester’s lead at the top in front of their own fans. However, Claudio Ranieri will surely be plotting another dazzling away win to keep his side on track for title glory. Graham Searles"
789,Swansea City,Southampton,Fri 12 Feb 2016 15.18 GMT,2015-16,"Fraser Forster has still to concede since being restored to the Saints goal and the team picked up 13 points in those five games while Swansea are finding some form themselves, undefeated in four, three of them under the new manager Francesco Guidolin. Ki Sung-yueng could return for them and the on-loan Leroy Fer is keen for a debut in front of his manager at Feyenoord, Ronald Koeman. Mark Tallentire"
790,Everton,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 12 Feb 2016 14.52 GMT,2015-16,"Everton are once again moving in the right direction after recording successive league wins. West Brom, in stark contrast, are without a win in their last five in the league and there is serious danger that Tony Pulis’s side will become embroiled in the battle to avoid relegation. West Brom are still short of options in defence, with Gareth McAuley out with a hamstring problem. Everton, meanwhile, could hand a debut to attacker Oumar Niasse, a former Lokomotiv Moscow player known for his pace and power. Jeorge Bird"
791,Aston Villa,Liverpool,Fri 12 Feb 2016 14.23 GMT,2015-16,"Rémi Garde’s team are showing signs of life at the bottom having lost one of their last five league games, although there were also signs of defensive vulnerability during last weekend’s win over Norwich City. With Philippe Coutinho, Daniel Sturridge and Divock Origi back from injury, Roberto Firmino scoring five goals in his last six outings and Christian Benteke anxious to face his former club, Jürgen Klopp finally has options to exploit Aston Villa’s weaknesses. But, as he admitted: “It is not a coincidence we are ninth and Villa are where they are.” Andy Hunter"
792,Bournemouth,Stoke City,Fri 12 Feb 2016 11.58 GMT,2015-16,"Stoke are without a league win since the turn of the year and travel to Bournemouth on the back of three straight losses. Eddie Howe, in contrast, has steered his side away from the relegation zone and a win here could edge them closer to mid-table and within two points of Mark Hughes’s side. Stoke’s wobbling resolve will be tested once more, while Benik Afobe is in search of his fourth Bournemouth goal in five matches. Ben Fisher"
793,Newcastle United,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 5 Feb 2016 18.35 GMT,2015-16,"What price for Saido Berahino stepping off the bench to score the winner for Tony Pulis’s side? Following West Brom’s rejection of Newcastle’s £21m bid for the forward, that is probably the stuff of Steve McClaren’s nightmares. If relegation is to be avoided – and if he is to keep his job – this really looks a must-win game for the Tynesiders. That task is complicated by an injury crisis. Despite investing £80m in new players this season, McClaren has only three fit senior defenders. Louise Taylor"
794,Swansea City,Crystal Palace,Fri 5 Feb 2016 18.01 GMT,2015-16,"After such a bleak run, Swansea have picked up seven points from a possible nine to scramble clear of the bottom three and they badly need to continue that momentum against an out-of-form Crystal Palace. Alan Pardew’s team have dropped from fifth to 12th place after losing five league games on the spin and their long injury list now includes the names of James McArthur and Jason Puncheon. Alberto Paloschi looks sets to make his full debut for Swansea, who will be without Ki Sung-yueng. Stuart James"
795,Liverpool,Sunderland,Fri 5 Feb 2016 17.49 GMT,2015-16,"Jürgen Klopp has a different problem in his attempt to keep supporters inside Anfield, with the fans’ group Spion Kop 1906 calling for a mass walkout in the 77th minute against Sunderland in protest at Liverpool’s new ticket price structure featuring £77 seats. On the pitch Liverpool need the cutting edge that was notable by its absence in the midweek defeat at Leicester City. Relegation-threatened Sunderland have not won at Anfield since October 1983. Andy Hunter"

However, injuries to Rudy Gestede and Libor Kozak have left Rémi Garde with just Gabriel Agbonlahor as his only fit striker. Norwich welcome Robbie Brady back as they look to end their dreadful run of losses and stay out of the relegation zone. Gregg Bakowski Kick-off Saturday 3pm "
797,Manchester City,Leicester City,Fri 5 Feb 2016 17.09 GMT,2015-16,Despite Leicester City arriving as leaders by three points the smart money remains on Manchester City beating them to close the deficit.

Jamie Jackson
798,Southampton,West Ham United,Fri 5 Feb 2016 16.53 GMT,2015-16,"It will be worth keeping an eye on Charlie Austin as he makes his home debut for Southampton against the club that took a pass on him. Ronald Koeman’s side are in rich form and will hope Austin’s predatory skills help to close some of the gap to the team above them in sixth. West Ham are hard to beat, though, and have Andy Carroll available again after recovering from injury. Gregg Bakowski"
799,Chelsea,Manchester United,Fri 5 Feb 2016 16.42 GMT,2015-16,"This is a tale of two seasoned Dutch managers who have not always seen eye to eye, but are now locked in a pursuit of Champions League football. Louis van Gaal can still aspire to achieve that via the domestic league. Guus Hiddink may have to target claiming a European Cup to leave his team competing for another. His side’s 10-match unbeaten run masks the reality they have yet to win a Premier League game at Stamford Bridge since he rejoined the club. This would be a fine moment to break that duck. Dominic Fifield"
800,Bournemouth,Arsenal,Fri 5 Feb 2016 16.18 GMT,2015-16,"Arsenal are back in fourth. How did that happen? And they are well aware that they face a stern test at Dean Court. Bournemouth, who have been pepped up front by former Arsenal trainee Benik Afobe, have won five of their past 10 league games and Arsène Wenger is among those who are convinced that they will stay up. “They have enough substance in their game,” Wenger said. Arsenal must calm the jangling nerves. David Hytner"
801,Tottenham Hotspur,Watford,Fri 5 Feb 2016 16.02 GMT,2015-16,"After four wins on the road, Tottenham return to White Hart Lane with optimism building. To sustain that they will need the new central defensive partnership of Kevin Wimmer and Toby Alderweireld to shut out Watford’s deadly duo of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo. That is the stiffest test Spurs have faced since the loss of Jan Vertonghen to injury and if they pass it, especially if Dele Alli is unavailale through illness, then Premier League title talk will grow. Paul Doyle"
802,Stoke City,Everton,Fri 5 Feb 2016 15.23 GMT,2015-16,"Stoke City and Everton are both playing below par. Stoke have won once in the league in 2016 and have scored once in their past five matches, while Everton are 11th despite scoring more goals than everyone apart from the top three. Mark Hughes, who could start Stoke’s record signing Giannelli Imbula, needs his attack to click, Everton need their defence to cut out the errors. Jacob Steinberg"
803,Oxford United,Blackburn Rovers,Fri 29 Jan 2016 18.28 GMT,2015-16,"Blackburn are on a poor run in the Championship at the moment having not won in their past seven games. However, they should still pose more of a threat to Oxford Utd than Swansea City did in the previous round. Michael Appleton will be keen to show his former employers, of just 67 days, that Oxford can upset the odds once again in this year’s FA Cup. And they look well placed to do so. Appleton’s side are strong contenders for promotion to League One with Kemar Roofe’s performances being a particular highlight. Graham Searles"
804,Nottingham Forest,Watford,Fri 29 Jan 2016 17.59 GMT,2015-16,"Watford ran out 3-1 winners at the City Ground, when Quique Flores’s side and Nottingham Forest last met in April. This helped Watford secure promotion to the Premier League and condemned Forest to another season in the second tier. Dougie Freedman’s side have not conceded in their last three games. However, as the hosts still look for a man to replace injured striker Britt Assombalonga’s goals it will be the formidable Troy Deeney they will have to watch out for. Charlie Dear"
805,MK Dons,Chelsea,Fri 29 Jan 2016 17.29 GMT,2015-16,"MK Dons’ first game at Stadium MK was against a Chelsea XI back in the summer of 2007, a friendly the hosts won 4-3, and they have come a long way since then. The majority in a full house will cheer on Karl Robinson’s Championship side, struggling in the second tier with this occasion presumably a welcome relief, against the Premier League champions whose interim manager, Guus Hiddink, is hoping to claim this trophy for a second time. Chelsea cannot afford to pass up on their best chance of silverware this season. Dominic Fifield"
806,Aston Villa,Manchester City,Fri 29 Jan 2016 17.19 GMT,2015-16,"Now that Manchester City are in the Capital One Cup final the word quadruple is starting to be mentioned. That may be optimistic, but a second cup run is possible. Aston Villa are in no position to dream of a Wembley return, and even though this is an all-Premier League affair it would count as the shock of the round should the home side prevail. However, with Rémy Garde’s side enjoying a welcome break from their dismal league campaign, Villa could produce something special. Paul Wilson"
807,Portsmouth,Bournemouth,Fri 29 Jan 2016 17.05 GMT,2015-16,"Eight years is a long time in football, especially on the south coast. Back in 2008, Portsmouth were on their way to winning the FA Cup under Harry Redknapp while Bournemouth were eliminated in the second round by Millwall having scraped past non-league Barrow in a replay in the first round. The Cherries ended up being relegated from League One and survived dropping out of the Football League altogether by the skin of their teeth the following season. In 2016, the meeting of two clubs separated by 50 miles has seen their traditional roles reversed so it will be intriguing to see whether Portsmouth’s Paul Cook can plot a way past Eddie Howe’s Premier League side. Ed Aarons"
808,Reading,Walsall,Fri 29 Jan 2016 16.28 GMT,2015-16,"Walsall travel to the Madejski Stadium with the manager, Sean O’Driscoll, challenging his side to put on a performance similar to that in the previous round against Brentford and prove they can defeat a Championship side again. However, last year’s semi-finalists, Reading, have the returning trio of Michael Hector, Stephen Quinn and captain Paul McShane back in contention and Brian McDermott will be confident his side can repeat the previous campaign’s heroics. Charlie Dear"
809,Bury,Hull City,Fri 29 Jan 2016 16.18 GMT,2015-16,"The Bury manager, David Flitcroft, has told his players to take the opportunity the FA Cup presents as his side host Championship leaders, Hull City. Joe Riley could miss out for Bury amid speculation over his future at the club. Conversely, Steve Bruce has hinted he will be shuffling his pack and may give a debut to 16-year-old full-back Josh Tymon. Hull have progressed from 10 of their last 11 FA Cup ties but the last time these two sides met in this competition in 1914 Bury won 2-1. Charlie Dear"
810,West Bromwich Albion,Peterborough United,Fri 29 Jan 2016 16.05 GMT,2015-16,"Having failed to register a shot on target against Aston Villa in the league last week, West Brom fans can take solace from the fact they cannot show any less attacking intent against League One opposition. They should still not expect free-flowing excitement to break out any time soon, though. Peterborough’s sale of Conor Washington to QPR has left them short on goals too. Graham Westley’s side are pushing for a play-off place in League One but have only one point from their last three games and have not won since defeating Preston 2-0 in the last round on 9 January. Alan Smith"
811,Liverpool,West Ham United,Fri 29 Jan 2016 15.40 GMT,2015-16,"Slaven Bilic’s team have recorded a league double over Liverpool this season – West Ham United’s first in 52 years – but the Croat is unhappy with a Cup draw that provides chance of a hat-trick. Manuel Lanzini and Diafra Sakho scored in the 3-0 win at Anfield but are accompanied by Andy Carroll on the injury list, while Jürgen Klopp will be wary of any lingering effects from Tuesday’s exhausting Capital One Cup semi-final shootout win over Stoke City. Andy Hunter"
812,Shrewsbury Town,Sheffield Wednesday,Fri 29 Jan 2016 15.28 GMT,2015-16,"Shrewsbury are struggling in League One but have already defeated another Championship side, Cardiff City, on home soil in the previous round. Micky Mellon said of his side’s chances: “It’s all about belief. We’re capable of anything, from one extreme to the other.” Sheffield Wednesday will therefore see the taming of the Shrews as eminently possible providing they continue their impressive cup form this season. The 3-0 defeat of Arsenal in the League Cup was a standout display that if replicated will ensure victory for Carlos Carvalhal. Graham Searles"
813,Colchester United,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 29 Jan 2016 15.00 GMT,2015-16,"This tie, pitting Colchester United who are seven points adrift of safety in League One against a Tottenham Hotspur side that find themselves five from the Premier League summit, is certainly the stuff shocks are made of. Colchester can call on experienced heads such as Darren Ambrose, Nicky Shorey and Owen Garvan to aid their cause in the clubs’ first competitive meeting and a capacity crowd at the Weston Homes Community Stadium will hope they can relive past glories. Nick Ames"
814,Arsenal,Burnley,Fri 29 Jan 2016 14.48 GMT,2015-16,"According to Arsène Wenger, it is “not like 10 years ago”, when top Premier League teams would roll over those from the Championship. “They compete at the right level,” the Arsenal manager said, and he knows his players can take nothing for granted as they seek to finish a stodgy January on a high. Burnley, third in the Championship, are aware that only one lower league team has toppled Wenger’s Arsenal in 40 FA Cup ties – their Lancashire rivals, Blackburn, in 2013. David Hytner"
815,Crystal Palace,Stoke City,Fri 29 Jan 2016 14.24 GMT,2015-16,"A battle between two improved Premier League sides may see the return of Emmanuel Adebayor. His jaunt around London now sees his arrival at Selhurst Park. Stoke City have beaten Chelsea, Manchester United and Manchester City at home but Crystal Palace will look to capitalise on their poor away form this season. However, Mark Hughes will be extremely motivated to put Stoke’s bitter penalty loss to Liverpool in the Capital One Cup semi-final behind them with victory . Charlie Dear"
816,Bolton Wanderers,Leeds United,Fri 29 Jan 2016 14.08 GMT,2015-16,"This is arguably an easier game for Leeds than Eastleigh, who Bolton overcame in a third-round replay. Bolton are rooted to the bottom of the Championship. Nevertheless, the captain Darren Pratley is starting to rediscover the kind of form that helped Swansea to promotion in 2011 and will be looking to continue his goalscoring run in the competition. As for Leeds, life after Sam Byram has started solidly with four points from two games but a good FA Cup run could be the perfect distraction from an indifferent league campaign. Charlie Dear"
817,Carlisle United,Everton,Fri 29 Jan 2016 13.10 GMT,2015-16,"After League Cup – and Premier League – disappointments Everton could do with a decent FA Cup run and certainly need to avoid becoming victims of a giant-killing. With Keith Curle optimistic his League Two side’s “journey” can continue into the fifth round, Roberto Martínez would surely be wise to field a strong side in front of a capacity crowd at Brunton Park. However, an upset is unlikely as Carlisle last defeated a top-flight side in the Cup way back in 1986. Louise Taylor"
818,Everton,Swansea City,Fri 22 Jan 2016 18.05 GMT,2015-16,"Swansea won a game at long last in their previous outing against Watford, Everton dropped two points in a game they should have won by conceding in the 98th minute at Chelsea. The upshot is that the home side are still a point away from the top half of the table, the visitors just a point above the relegation positions. If new coach Francesco Guidolin is going to make a difference at the Welsh club, today would be a good time to start. Paul Wilson"
819,Arsenal,Chelsea,Fri 22 Jan 2016 17.42 GMT,2015-16,"Arsène Wenger insists this is a derby against “direct rivals”, but there is little evidence to suggest last season’s champions will raise their game and disrupt the current leaders’ progress. Four of Chelsea’s six league wins this season have come against teams in the bottom eight, with the others against a Crystal Palace side on the turn and an Arsenal lineup reduced to nine men. That loss to José Mourinho in September will still rile Wenger, though the onus is now on Guus Hiddink to prove his unbeaten six-match tenure is no false dawn. Dominic Fifield"
820,West Bromwich Albion,Aston Villa,Fri 22 Jan 2016 17.33 GMT,2015-16,"While Aston Villa’s performances have improved slightly in recent weeks, their form needs to get better quicker if they are to eat up the 10-point gap to safety. West Bromwich are safely positioned in mid-table and despite a host of injuries to key players, leaving Tony Pulis concerned, they will be fancied to complete a league double over their neighbours for the first time in 42 years. Alan Smith"
821,Watford,Newcastle United,Fri 22 Jan 2016 16.57 GMT,2015-16,"Of their last nine league games Watford won the first four and lost the last four, with a draw in the middle. Their recent form means that for the first time since August there is some concern about their prospects this season, a wobble they will attempt to end by completing a treble over Newcastle, who have not lost in two matches since they were undeservedly beaten here in the FA Cup a fortnight ago. “It is a tough challenge to beat them again, but this is our target, to play well and replicate those good feelings,” said Quique Sánchez Flores. Watford’s record signing Nordin Amrabat should make his debut at some stage. Simon Burnton"
822,Norwich City,Liverpool,Fri 22 Jan 2016 16.15 GMT,2015-16,"This is a happy hunting ground for Liverpool, winning their last four visits, and despite their erratic recent form should have enough to deepen Norwich’s woe. Consecutive defeats have left City two points above safety but those were both away. They are undefeated in five at Carrow Road. Alex Neil might give Steven Naismith his debut after the Scotland striker’s move from Everton was confirmed. Alan Smith"
823,Crystal Palace,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 22 Jan 2016 16.06 GMT,2015-16,"Crystal Palace are on a dire run of two points from their last five games, failing to score in all and shipping eight in the past three. Everything points to a Tottenham win, then. Mauricio Pochettino’s team came from behind to easily beat Sunderland last Saturday and also impressed in the FA Cup at Leicester. A Champions League spot is within their reach, but could they go all the way? Alan Smith"
824,West Ham United,Manchester City,Fri 22 Jan 2016 15.51 GMT,2015-16,"West Ham can complete a first league double over Manchester City in 53 years and will fancy their chances given their run of one loss in nine games, albeit that being last week’s defeat at Newcastle. For City there is the opportunity to leapfrog Arsenal, and having tightened up at the back and containing Sergio Agüero in attack, the visitors will also feel confident of winning. Sachin Nakrani"
825,Manchester United,Southampton,Fri 22 Jan 2016 15.30 GMT,2015-16,Now is the time for Manchester United to embark on a winter-into-spring run to prove Louis van Gaal’s claim they can still seriously challenge for the title. Before them are a Southampton side who were beaten 3-2 in the reverse fixture and who have seven points fewer than United’s 37. Earlier this term Van Gaal’s men went 11 games unbeaten in all competitions of which only four were victories. The current sequence is five with three wins. This ratio has to continue into March at least. Jamie Jackson
826,Leicester City,Stoke City,Fri 22 Jan 2016 14.57 GMT,2015-16,"Leicester have kept tabs with their title rivals despite a run of only one win from five but victory here is vital with games against Liverpool, Manchester City and Arsenal to follow. Claudio Ranieri says he is not worried about Jamie Vardy’s seven-match run without a goal, while Riyad Mahrez has also not found the net in five having also missed two penalties. Stoke will be tough to break down and rapid on the counter. Alan Smith"
827,Sunderland,Bournemouth,Fri 22 Jan 2016 14.43 GMT,2015-16,"Friends reunited is the subplot of a game Sam Allardyce says his Sunderland side simply cannot afford to lose. With the Wearsiders seemingly averse to drawing under Allardyce’s charge much may depend on the performances of two former Bournemouth loanees, Jermain Defoe and John O’Shea in the home ranks. Both played in the same south coast team as Eddie Howe and Jason Tindall, now the visiting manager and assistant manager. Defoe even lodged with Tindall with the then defender cooking for him. Louise Taylor"
828,Swansea City,Watford,Fri 15 Jan 2016 18.46 GMT,2015-16,"Swansea were justified to feel hard done by after suffering at the hands of awful refereeing in defeat to Sunderland midweek. Kyle Naughton’s suspension has been overturned, however, and is clear to play here against a side that has hit something of a slump recently, losing three and drawing one of their last four in the league. Watford did, however, win against Newcastle in the FA Cup. Alan Smith"
829,Liverpool,Manchester United,Fri 15 Jan 2016 18.12 GMT,2015-16,"It does not help Richard Scudamore’s sales pitch to global broadcasters that a clash between the league’s biggest clubs is simply a contest between ninth and sixth in the table, but the significance of this game will not be lost on Jürgen Klopp and Louis van Gaal. Two very different managers want the same thing – evidence of genuine improvement – as they look to close the gap on the top four. Van Gaal has never lost to Liverpool and Klopp has never faced United before. League positions will be forgotten come kick-off. Andy Hunter"
830,Stoke City,Arsenal,Fri 15 Jan 2016 17.45 GMT,2015-16,"Stoke have already taken the scalps of both Manchester clubs at home this season and, having beaten Arsenal last season, will relish the opportunity of checking another title hopeful. That 3-2 defeat for Arsène Wenger’s team was marked by some travelling supporters abusing their players at the train station afterwards. Defeat here, though, is no longer considered a disaster. Alan Smith"
831,Manchester City,Crystal Palace,Fri 15 Jan 2016 17.08 GMT,2015-16,"Although they could find no way past Everton in midweek, Manchester City have the division’s best home record. Crystal Palace might be short of goals and lost at Aston Villa on Tuesday but they have impressed more away from home than at Selhurst Park, thanks to blistering pace on the counter, meaning City will need to be at their sharpest to return to winning ways and maintain their title challenge. Alan Smith"
832,Newcastle United,West Ham United,Fri 15 Jan 2016 16.46 GMT,2015-16,The good news for Steve McClaren and Slaven Bilic is that the weather forecast suggests it will be dry so there should be no need for agonising over head coverings. The former England coach could do with building on Tuesday’s spirited draw against Manchester United by beating his one time Croatia counterpart but West Ham have their sights on Europe – and Dimitri Payet back in midfield. With Jonjo Shelvey likely to make his Newcastle debut in the same department an interesting subplot looms. Louise Taylor
833,Chelsea,Everton,Fri 15 Jan 2016 15.40 GMT,2015-16,"Chelsea remain unbeaten under Guus Hiddink but after being pegged back by West Bromwich Albion on Wednesday are still only six points above the relegation places. Can Romelu Lukaku inflict more pain on his former club and earn Everton a first league win in four? The league’s joint top scorer failed to strike against Manchester City in midweek, but has 10 from his past 11 games. Alan Smith"
834,Tottenham Hotspur,Sunderland,Fri 15 Jan 2016 15.06 GMT,2015-16,"Tottenham’s defeat to Leicester, conceding a late Robert Huth header, on Wednesday was a major blow to their title ambitions. They will be expected to return to winning ways here and strengthen their grip on a Champions League place against a side that were buoyed by winning at Swansea but remain beset by a shaky defence that has not kept a clean sheet since November. Alan Smith"
835,Southampton,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 15 Jan 2016 14.50 GMT,2015-16,Southampton are feeling much better about themselves after beating Watford on Wednesday night and the visit of West Bromwich Albion presents them with a good chance to win consecutive matches for the first time since early November. But West Brom should not be underestimated. Tony Pulis’s side are below Southampton only on goal difference and they were excellent in their 2-2 draw at Chelsea on Wednesday. Jacob Steinberg
836,Bournemouth,Norwich City,Fri 15 Jan 2016 14.06 GMT,2015-16,"Two points separate Bournemouth and Norwich, who are both lingering above the bottom three. The hosts re-signed Lewis Grabban from Norwich on Monday, with the manager, Alex Neil, describing the striker as a worthless commodity. Grabban, who scored 35 goals in two seasons during his first spell at Bournemouth, will doubtless be keen to prove his worth again. Ben Fisher"
837,Aston Villa,Leicester City,Fri 15 Jan 2016 13.59 GMT,2015-16,"Both achieved important 1-0 wins in midweek, albeit for very different reasons. Aston Villa very much remain in the mire, though, while Leicester, despite the goals drying up somewhat in recent weeks, have been tough to break down, keeping a clean sheet in their past three league outings. Villa led by two goals in the reverse fixture only to fall apart in the second half and concede three. Alan Smith"
838,Sunderland,Aston Villa,Fri 1 Jan 2016 18.38 GMT,2015-16,"Aston Villa pose an excellent opportunity for Sunderland to return to winning ways after losing five successive games. Critically for Sunderland’s chances Villa will be without their solitary shining light this season, Jordan Ayew. However, Sunderland have absentees of their own at the back and could miss Sebastián Coates and John O’Shea, although that might be a blessing in disguise considering Sam Allardyce’s side have conceded a whopping 38 goals so far. Graham Searles"
839,Arsenal,Newcastle United,Fri 1 Jan 2016 18.17 GMT,2015-16,"Arsenal will relish facing relegation contenders Newcastle to banish further the memory of that Boxing Day knockout delivered by Southampton. Arsenal have not lost at home since the season’s opening day and that, coupled with Arsène Wenger masterminding victories in his last eight encounters with Newcastle, makes it unlikely Steve McClaren will turn over a new leaf to begin 2016.

840,Watford,Manchester City,Fri 1 Jan 2016 17.56 GMT,2015-16,"Manchester City travel to Vicarage Road looking for their first away victory since Kelechi Iheanacho scored that late winner against Crystal Palace on 12 September. Man City’s goalless draw with Leicester City on Tuesday left them three points off the top and they cannot afford any complacency against Watford, who have taken four points off Chelsea and Liverpool in the past fortnight. With Vincent Kompany absent, Odion Ighalo will fancy his chances. The Watford striker has seven goals in his past six matches. Jacob Steinberg"
841,West Bromwich,Stoke City,Fri 1 Jan 2016 17.36 GMT,2015-16,"Tony Pulis will welcome his former side to the Hawthorns safe in the knowledge he has never been on the losing side in this fixture. Saido Berahino is expected to start for the first time since October, as Victor Anichebe and Salomón Rondón are injured and suspended respectively. West Brom will have to contend with an in form Marko Arnautovic, who has been passed fit despite a tight hamstring. Mark Hughes will hope his side continue the scintillating football they have displayed at points this season, in marked contrast to the Pulis era. Martin White"
842,Leicester City,Bournemouth,Fri 1 Jan 2016 16.56 GMT,2015-16,"This would probably have been billed as a relegation six-pointer at the start of the year. Jamie Vardy began his record-breaking run with a goal against Bournemouth, and will hope to add to his impressive tally. Claudio Ranieri’s side face a Bournemouth side who are in good form. Eddie Howe has coaxed the best out of his depleted squad, so could a shock be on the cards at the King Power? Martin White"
843,Norwich City,Southampton,Fri 1 Jan 2016 16.41 GMT,2015-16,"A good return in December has put a sliver of daylight between Norwich and the relegation places, and victory here would put them only one point behind a Southampton side whose momentum from thrashing Arsenal was halted at West Ham. Alex Neil is believed to be working on deals for Steven Naismith and the Dinamo Zagreb right-back Ivo Pinto; Norwich are certain to strengthen this month but will hope that Dieumerci Mbokani’s goal against Aston Villa on Tuesday marked the start of an overdue run of form for one of their existing front men. Nick Ames"
844,Manchester United,Swansea City,Fri 1 Jan 2016 16.25 GMT,2015-16,The considerable constituency gunning for Louis van Gaal to be removed from his job were quietened following Manchester United’s goalless draw with Chelsea. Expect the snipers to start baying again should United lose to Swansea City at Old Trafford. Van Gaal is minded not to walk away but he knows a ninth match without a win will make life uncomfortable for him once more. Jamie Jackson
845,Everton,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 1 Jan 2016 15.57 GMT,2015-16,"Everton will be keen to bounce back from Monday’s defeat by Stoke against Tottenham who are hoping to cement their place in the top four. Everton have a dreadful record against Spurs, winning none of their last six Premier League games against them. So, Romelu Lukaku’s blistering form will need to continue to give Everton a chance. Spurs will be looking to extend their winning run to four games for the first time since January 2014, but they will have to do it without Moussa Dembélé, who has been ruled out with a groin injury. Martin White"
846,West Ham United,Liverpool,Fri 1 Jan 2016 15.41 GMT,2015-16,"West Ham’s 3-0 victory at Anfield in August spelt the beginning of the end for Brendan Rodgers and for his successor as Liverpool manager, Jürgen Klopp, the aim is to see his team record a third successive win at the start of a month the German has described as “crucial”. Both sides have injury headaches, although the hosts will be boosted by Dimitri Payet’s return to action. Sachin Nakrani"
847,Crystal Palace,Chelsea,Fri 1 Jan 2016 13.06 GMT,2015-16,"Palace are chasing the league double over Chelsea, having won at Stamford Bridge last August – the first real shock of the José Mourinho implosion. And, as the form team, nobody would bet against them. Palace have lost only once in their previous nine games to sit fifth, although injuries and Yohan Cabaye’s ban stand to undermine them. Their compact and fast-breaking style will ask questions of Chelsea who welcome back Diego Costa from suspension. David Hytner"
848,Liverpool,Leicester City,Thu 24 Dec 2015 14.39 GMT,2015-16,"A week on from securing the Christmas No1 spot with victory at Everton, Claudio Ranieri’s team return to Merseyside looking to further their remarkable title claims at the expense of a Liverpool side struggling for form and fit central defenders. Jürgen Klopp’s men have collected only one point from the past nine available and, with Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez in town, have suffered the untimely loss of Martin Skrtel to a hamstring injury. With Dejan Lovren returning to training only on Wednesday, Klopp may have to make do with Kolo Touré and Mamadou Sakho at the heart of defence for Liverpool’s 4,000th game in the top flight. Andy Hunter"
849,Newcastle United,Everton,Thu 24 Dec 2015 13.24 GMT,2015-16,"Much may hinge on the respective performances of two former Anderlecht centre-forwards, Newcastle’s Aleksandar Mitrovic and Everton’s Romelu Lukaku. Although Steve McClaren’s side have shown signs of definite improvement in recent weeks they remain fourth bottom – not great for a club whose declared pre-season target was a top eight place. Accordingly Mike Ashley, the owner, will want to see evidence that the recent mini renaissance is genuine. A lot here though could depend on how Paul Dummett copes with Everton’s Gerard Deulofeu. Louise Taylor"
850,Stoke City,Manchester United,Thu 24 Dec 2015 12.00 GMT,2015-16,"Louis van Gaal is free to continue as Manchester United manager but desperately needs to stop the run of six games without a win that has seen his team drop out of the Champions League places. United have fallen nine points off the lead and Van Gaal’s assertion that they could be top in the next four weeks seems optimistic, to say the least. Stoke, with six clean sheets in their last eight games, will be tricky opponents, but are coming off the back of a home defeat to Crystal Palace. Daniel Taylor"
851,Chelsea,Watford,Thu 24 Dec 2015 12.00 GMT,2015-16,"Watford should offer a far sterner test of Chelsea’s capabilities than Sunderland last Saturday, with this a potentially enlightening afternoon for Guus Hiddink. The Dutchman’s second spell in interim charge will begin with a late fitness test for Eden Hazard and a reminder to his players that fourth place is still attainable if an instant upturn in form can be instigated. Not that the visitors will be shrinking at the thought of what awaits. They will aspire to securing a first win in this arena since May 1986 when David Bardsley scored twice in a 5-1 win. Dominic Fifield"
852,Southampton,Arsenal,Thu 24 Dec 2015 12.00 GMT,2015-16,"This fixture has unhappy memories for Arsenal from last season. They lost it 2-0 on New Year’s Day, after two Wojciech Szczesny errors, and then there was a kerfuffle about the goalkeeper smoking by the showers afterwards. And yet it was to be a turning point. Since then, Arsenal have lost only five Premier League matches and they return to St Mary’s with genuine title hopes. Southampton desperately need a tonic after a run of five losses and a draw. David Hytner"
853,Manchester City,Sunderland,Thu 24 Dec 2015 12.00 GMT,2015-16,"It is hard to think of a worse place for Sam Allardyce’s side to be visiting on the back of three defeats – Sunderland have not won at Manchester City since Janaury 1998, when Kevin Phillips got the only goal of the game. The Sunderland manager has recalled Jeremain Lens to the squad after a disciplinary incident earlier in the month and called on the £8m signing to “prove that he’s an immense talent”, it will be interesting to see how the Dutchman responds. Rich Flower"
854,Tottenham Hotspur,Norwich City,Thu 24 Dec 2015 12.00 GMT,2015-16,"Norwich badly needed a win last week and they got one – perhaps somewhat surprisingly – at Old Trafford, a ground where they have not enjoyed a victory since August 1989. Tottenham should provide a sterner test than Louis van Gaal’s insipid Manchester United did and the fresh confidence of Alex Neil’s side will be tested. Harry Kane will be aiming to impress against the club where he spent an underwhelming loan spell in the 2012-13 season. Rich Flower"
855,Swansea City,West Bromwich Albion,Thu 24 Dec 2015 12.00 GMT,2015-16,"This has to go down as a must-win game for Swansea, who are still without a manager and have slipped into the bottom three on the back of one victory from their past 13 league matches. Sunday’s goalless draw with West Ham highlighted their biggest problem – a toothless attack. Tony Pulis’ team have failed to win in four and are without Salomón Rondón and James McClean, both of whom start three-match bans. Saido Berahino is set to start for the first time since October. Stuart James"
856,Bournemouth,Crystal Palace,Thu 24 Dec 2015 12.00 GMT,2015-16,"The firepower in Crystal Palace’s final third can scare most teams – including Bournemouth – who have kept just two clean sheets this season. The Cherries will attempt to mute the threat of the much admired duo of Yannick Bolasie and Wilfried Zaha but they, too, possess star quality in the wide areas. Two of the division’s form sides meet, with the home side unbeaten in five while Palace arrive on the south coast looking up at the top four. Ben Fisher"
857,Aston Villa,West Ham United,Thu 24 Dec 2015 12.00 GMT,2015-16,"Aston Villa, without a victory since the opening day of the season, will fancy their chances against a West Ham side that have not had a win since 24 October. It is surely not coincidental that the slump in form for Slaven Bilic’s side has come while Dimitri Payet has been absent with an ankle injury and his return in the new year will be welcome. Rémi Garde can draw little comfort from the fact he has almost a full squad to choose from as his crop of players have proved inadequate thus far. Rich Flower"
858,Swansea City,West Ham United,Fri 18 Dec 2015 18.40 GMT,2015-16,"If Swansea can produce the energetic display that almost enabled them to snatch a draw last Saturday at Manchester City they could have the beating of West Ham, who remain stricken by multiple key injuries. Slaven Bilic’s attacking replacements have not been able to fill the void left by Dimitri Payet, in particular, but Bilic should still be faithful against Swansea, who have not won in their last six league games. Graham Searles"
859,Stoke City,Crystal Palace,Fri 18 Dec 2015 18.10 GMT,2015-16,"Stoke City and Crystal Palace are two of the most physically dominant sides in the league and both will look to dominate the other from the outset. Mark Hughes should have the edge, however, as Stoke beat Manchester City emphatically in their last home fixture. Goals will be at a premium as Stoke have kept clean sheets in seven of their last nine league games and Palace have conceded only six away from home this season. Graham Searles"
860,Chelsea,Sunderland,Fri 18 Dec 2015 17.16 GMT,2015-16,"For the second time in eight years José Mourinho has been sacked by Chelsea and interest lies in just how the team reacts. They desperately need a win against opponents who also find themselves in relegation strife and the suspicion is that with Guus Hiddink poised to take over on a temporary basis again, the hosts will rise to the occasion now the man who accused them of a “betrayal” has left. Sachin Nakrani"
861,Arsenal,Manchester City,Fri 18 Dec 2015 16.37 GMT,2015-16,"Given how often they were in his firing line neither Arsène Wenger nor Manuel Pellegrini will have shed too many tears over José Mourinho, which leaves them as the only current top-flight managers to have won the Premier League title. Both would very much like to do so again, however, so expect respective matchwinners Alexis Sánchez and Sergio Agüero to return earlier than expected. Paul Chronnell"
862,West Bromwich Albion,Bournemouth,Fri 18 Dec 2015 16.18 GMT,2015-16,Bournemouth have shrugged off their injury crisis and have shown excellent spirit to beat Chelsea and Manchester United consecutively. Eddie Howe will not be daunted by visiting The Hawthorns after such great results but Tony Pulis will have prepared West Brom accordingly to try to halt their progression. The fact the visitors concede more than two goals per game on the road could prove a telling statistic. Graham Searles
863,Watford,Liverpool,Fri 18 Dec 2015 15.53 GMT,2015-16,"For the first time in their history – this will be their 25th meeting and, unusually, the sixth in succession, four of them in the league, to be played in either December or January – Watford prepare to take on Liverpool while sitting above them in the league. The Hornets have won all of their past three games – and their opponents none of theirs – and the continued absence of the hamstrung Daniel Sturridge will make the Reds’ task more difficult against a home side who have no significant injuries and have yet to lose this season against any side below them in the league. Simon Burnton"
864,Southampton,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 18 Dec 2015 15.42 GMT,2015-16,"Three defeats in four league games – as well as that chastening Capital One Cup defeat to Liverpool – have taken the sheen off Southampton’s start to the season and the visit of their former manager, Mauricio Pochettino, presents a good opportunity to blow the cobwebs away. Another defeat or two could see them looking over their shoulders and Ronald Koeman will be hoping that Graziano Pellè, who had an injection to his injured knee, will be fit and perform somewhere close to his brilliant best. Nick Ames"
865,Newcastle United,Aston Villa,Fri 18 Dec 2015 15.31 GMT,2015-16,"Eleven months ago Rémi Garde seemed close to succeeding Alan Pardew at Newcastle but talks foundered and he now finds himself in charge of another club with a dubious recruitment policy – bottom-placed Aston Villa. Despite successive, morale-boosting wins against Liverpool and Spurs, Steve McClaren’s side remain vulnerable and will surely need to modify their recent counterattacking strategy against Garde’s side. Villa, though, have now gone 15 League games without victory. A few more stumbles and the Championship will be within touching distance. Louise Taylor"
866,Manchester United,Norwich City,Fri 18 Dec 2015 13.53 GMT,2015-16,"Louis van Gaal desperately needs the elixir of a victory. It could be scrappy, ugly and even achieved in the pedestrian style many Manchester United supporters have come to detest. To cast Norwich City in the role of easy victims is wrong. Still, if United cannot defeat a side who are third from bottom and have just 14 points then the Old Trafford crowd could turn spiteful come 5pm on Saturday. Jamie Jackson"
867,Everton,Leicester City,Fri 18 Dec 2015 12.52 GMT,2015-16,"Goodison Park would represent a significant test of Leicester City’s staying power even without Claudio Ranieri losing several key players to injury and suspension. Robert Huth, Danny Drinkwater and Jeffrey Schlupp will all be absent against an Everton team that is pleasing on the eye but not satisfying supporters with recent results. The league’s leading goalscorers, Jamie Vardy and Romelu Lukaku, go head to head on what feels an important afternoon for both managers. Andy Hunter"
868,Crystal Palace,Southampton,Fri 11 Dec 2015 18.31 GMT,2015-16,"Southampton would normally consider a trip to Selhurst Park appealing. They have won their last seven league games against Crystal Palace, matches played in the top two divisions, and cost Neil Warnock his job with a 3-1 success in south London a year ago. Yet they arrive amid a dip in form and Alan Pardew’s team will offer more of a test, particularly as they look to build upon last month’s 5-1 thrashing of Newcastle and improve upon their own indifferent home record. The return of Wilfried Zaha from suspension will add to their armoury, with this a reunion with former employers for Pardew, José Fonte and Jason Puncheon. Dominic Fifield"
869,Liverpool,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 11 Dec 2015 18.02 GMT,2015-16,"Jürgen Klopp will be seeking an immediate league response from his Liverpool side following their shock 2-0 defeat at St James’ Park last Sunday. They will be without Daniel Sturridge after he strained his hamstring at Newcastle. However, the in-form playmaker Philippe Coutinho could return to the starting lineup following his cameo from the bench in the Europa League against an Albion side sure to concede possession as they look to make it four consecutive league games without defeat. Conor Creamer"
870,Manchester City,Swansea City,Fri 11 Dec 2015 17.17 GMT,2015-16,"Manchester City face a side who are without a manager following the sacking of Garry Monk. This means Manuel Pellegrini’s team face an unknown proposition: the state of flux could be an advantage to them, or Swansea may be doubly determined to win this game for Monk. Either way following the fine midweek 4-2 victory over Borussia Mönchengladbach City will expect to draw level with the leaders Leicester, who are not in action until Monday evening’s visit of Chelsea. Jamie Jackson"
871,Sunderland,Watford,Fri 11 Dec 2015 16.43 GMT,2015-16,"Quique Sánchez Flores seems slightly offended by Sam Allardyce’s assertion that this ranks as a relegation six-pointer. “I understand what he’s saying but I will never in my life agree,” said Watford’s manager whose side sit 10th. “I have a different mentality.” Much may hinge on how the respective defences cope with Sunderland’s Duncan Watmore and Watford’s Odion Ighalo but Flores relishes the challenge ahead. “The atmosphere at their stadium will be amazing,” he said. “Sam Allardyce has changed Sunderland’s dynamic. We have to be ready to face several different systems.” Louise Taylor"
872,Leicester City,Chelsea,Fri 11 Dec 2015 15.56 GMT,2015-16,"Last season’s champions meet last season’s great escapees but the roles are curiously reversed as the Jamie Vardy and Riyad Mahrez-propelled Foxes take on a Chelsea side looking nervously over their shoulders at the relegation zone only two points beneath them. Together Vardy and Mahrez have found the net seven times more than Chelsea this season, while Willian is the player José Mourinho will look to for inspiration at the other end. Chris McMullan"
873,Aston Villa,Arsenal,Fri 11 Dec 2015 15.43 GMT,2015-16,"With Arsène Wenger in one dugout and Rémi Garde, the former Arsenal midfielder, in the other, this is a classic case of the master coming up against the apprentice. On the face of it there looks only one winner. Aston Villa, for whom Jack Grealish is back in contention after a spell on the naughty step, have gone a club-record 14 league games without a win and look nailed-on relegation candidates. Arsenal, on the other hand, ought to be oozing confidence after their emphatic midweek victory over Olympiakos. Stuart James"
874,Bournemouth,Manchester United,Fri 11 Dec 2015 15.14 GMT,2015-16,"Eddie Howe and Louis van Gaal have had very different weeks. If the Dutchman thought the goalless draw with West Ham was bad, he entered a whole new level of Old Trafford despair following defeat at Wolfsburg and a Champions League exit. However, United remain three points off the top but know that Bournemouth, buoyed by their fine win at Chelsea, could complete a quite miserable week. Paul Chronnell"
875,Tottenham Hotspur,Newcastle United,Fri 11 Dec 2015 14.09 GMT,2015-16,"The relief for Steve McClaren was palpable. “It looked like we’d never win another game,” Newcastle’s manager said, with a nod towards the mood after the defeats against Leicester and Crystal Palace, but win they did against Liverpool last Sunday. McClaren feels a little more secure, after his players produced a performance of hard running and focus, but it does not get any easier for him. Tottenham, unbeaten in 14 matches, have been outrun by very few opponents. David Hytner"
876,West Ham United,Stoke City,Fri 11 Dec 2015 13.34 GMT,2015-16,"The unpredictable nature of this season’s Premier League means that neither West Ham United nor Stoke City should be discounted as contenders for a European place. However, West Ham’s momentum has stalled. They have not won since beating Chelsea on 24 October and could be missing six key players, while Stoke will be confident after last weekend’s comprehensive victory over Manchester City. Mark Hughes’s side are unbeaten in their past three visits to Upton Park. Jacob Steinberg"
877,Norwich City,Everton,Fri 11 Dec 2015 13.04 GMT,2015-16,"Norwich’s inability to string a run of form together has done a disservice to their general play but the time for results is fast approaching. They visit Manchester United and Tottenham after this and Alex Neil could do with a performance against Everton that renders his attacking players, in particular, undroppable. He has chopped and changed in recent weeks without finding an effective combination; whoever is selected for this assignment should take heart that, at the worst, Roberto Martínez’s side usually give you a chance. Nick Ames"
878,Stoke City,Manchester City,Fri 4 Dec 2015 17.50 GMT,2015-16,"The Stoke captain, Ryan Shawcross, will be a welcome return for Mark Hughes after his side suffered a shock defeat at the hands of Sunderland last Saturday. Meanwhile, Manuel Pellegrini will be without Sergio Agüero and a host of other first-team regulars. Hughes should be plotting an upset of his own on Saturday but Manchester City still have an embarassment of attacking riches that could make light work of Stoke. Graham Searles"
879,Southampton,Aston Villa,Fri 4 Dec 2015 17.28 GMT,2015-16,"Three defeats in a row – the latest being that 6-1 home thrashing by Liverpool on Wednesday – has put pressure on Southampton and that could spell more bad news for Aston Villa. If Rémi Garde’s side are to inflict more pain on the Saints rather than extend their own hapless streak, then Adam Traoré, their lone shining light in last week’s defeat by Watford, will probably have to excel. But even that may not be enough against a Southampton side with superior quality in every position. Paul Doyle"
880,West Bromwich Albion,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 4 Dec 2015 16.56 GMT,2015-16,"Mauricio Pochettino has made no secret of wanting to buy another forward in January and will hope to check up on Saido Berahino, who threatened to go on strike after Spurs’ fourth bid for him was rejected last summer and has since managed three league goals. Albion have Chris Brunt available while a result for Spurs would equal the undefeated top-flight run of 14 from 1985. Mark Tallentire "
881,Manchester United,West Ham United,Fri 4 Dec 2015 16.40 GMT,2015-16,"Manchester United are third and only a point behind Leicester and Manchester City despite having played tepid football so far. West Ham United have beaten Arsenal, Liverpool and City on the road, and Chelsea at home. The success of Van Gaal’s team is built on a Scrooge-like defence, while Slaven Bilic’s men are unfazed by playing more heralded names. This could be a draw. Jamie Jackson"
882,Arsenal,Sunderland,Fri 4 Dec 2015 16.25 GMT,2015-16,"As if Arsène Wenger were not sufficiently stressed out by injuries and dropped points, he can now see his old rival, Sam Allardyce, riding into town, ready to add to his woes. Allardyce has tightened Sunderland up, led them to morale-boosting victories and he will ask a simple question of Arsenal – ‘Can you break us down?’ The animosity between the two has cooled but there is still no love lost. There could be even less by Saturday evening. David Hytner"
883,Newcastle United,Liverpool,Fri 4 Dec 2015 15.30 GMT,2015-16,"Steve McClaren could probably do without facing Jürgen Klopp’s renascent Liverpool in front of live television cameras. After presiding over only two league wins all season, Newcastle’s manager acknowledges he is in the dark about his precarious looking future on Tyneside and is unlikely to be cheered by memories of the last time he met Klopp. In 2011 a Bundesliga win for the German’s Dortmund side at McClaren’s Wolfsburg proved the Englishman’s penultimate game in charge before his sacking. Louise Taylor"
884,Swansea City,Leicester City,Fri 4 Dec 2015 14.55 GMT,2015-16,"Can Swansea be the team to stop Jamie Vardy from equalling the all-time top-flight goal record by scoring for a 12th successive game? On recent evidence, maybe not. Garry Monk’s team have not kept a clean sheet since drawing with Everton on 19 September, though their biggest worry at present is finding their opposition’s goal. Swansea have not scored in six of their past 10 games and that must improve if they are to stay above trouble. Alan Smith"
885,Everton,Crystal Palace,Fri 4 Dec 2015 14.35 GMT,2015-16,"Something about Merseyside brings the best out of Crystal Palace. The only team to have beaten Jürgen Klopp at Anfield this season have won their last two visits to Goodison Park 3-2 and confidence will not be an issue after their 5-1 trouncing of Newcastle United last weekend. Everton, who will give a late fitness test to James McCarthy, may have advanced into the Capital One Cup semi-finals in midweek but the two points dropped at Bournemouth still hurt Roberto Martínez. His team need a response. Andy Hunter"
886,Watford,Norwich City,Fri 4 Dec 2015 14.04 GMT,2015-16,"Norwich City travel to Vicarage Road buoyed by the point they earned against Arsenal last Sunday. However, Alex Neil will also be aware his side have won just once on the road in seven attempts this season. If Odion Ighalo and Troy Deeney can continue combining as effectively as they have done so far then Quique Sánchez Flores will be confident Watford can secure victory. Graham Searles"
887,Chelsea,Bournemouth,Fri 4 Dec 2015 12.59 GMT,2015-16,"Chelsea have kept three straight clean sheets, representative of an upturn in form of sorts, but will hope to extend their mini-revival against a Bournemouth side whose progress remains horribly undermined by injuries. Should Artur Boruc not prove his fitness then Ryan Allsop will start in goal with the teenager Jordan Holmes on the bench. The Australian was playing on loan with Weymouth in front of 349 fans at Hemel Hempstead last Saturday. His parents, over for Christmas, arrive on the day of the game and will presumably head straight for Stamford Bridge. Dominic Fifield"
888,West Ham United,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 27 Nov 2015 18.11 GMT,2015-16,"West Ham have not won since defeating Chelsea on 24 October, which will have prompted fears one of the club’s traditional mid-season slumps might be brewing. Last week’s mauling at Tottenham was certainly chastening and Slaven Bilic, shorn of his most creative player, Dimitri Payet, is also without his suspended captain Mark Noble against an Albion side buoyed by beating Arsenal 2-1. Tom Davies"
889,Liverpool,Swansea City,Fri 27 Nov 2015 18.01 GMT,2015-16,"With one win in 10 matches a visit to Jürgen Klopp’s Liverpool looks ominous for Garry Monk but, with Philippe Coutinho struggling with a hamstring problem and Lucas Leiva suspended, and the two have been key to their team’s recovery under the former Borussia Dortmund coach, Swansea will hope to frustrate at Anfield. Klopp has called for Liverpool to bring the devastating form that mauled Manchester City last weekend home with them. He is yet to taste a Premier League victory at Anfield but five wins from six matches in all competitions suggests the wait will not continue for long. Andy Hunter"
890,Aston Villa,Watford,Fri 27 Nov 2015 17.53 GMT,2015-16,"Watford’s Quique Sánchez Flores has backed the choice of his counterpart at Aston Villa, Rémi Garde, to drop Jack Grealish, saying he “understands” the decision. It remains to be seen whether the banishment of Grealish, one of the brightest prospects in a struggling side, will serve to galvanise the youngster but Watford will surely be glad he is absent for such a crucial game near the foot of the table. Rich Flower"
891,Crystal Palace,Newcastle United,Fri 27 Nov 2015 16.58 GMT,2015-16,"Palace host a second side from the north-east in less than a week and Alan Pardew will be desperate to improve on the Sunderland performance when they take on the side he left in January after five years in charge. Marouane Chamakh came on in that one and is an option again after injury while Newcastle, who have not lost to Palace since 1998, should have Jack Colback available again. Mark Tallentire"
892,Manchester City,Southampton,Fri 27 Nov 2015 15.54 GMT,2015-16,Manchester City last won a Premier League game on the final day of October – five matches ago. Southampton have two victories from their past three top-flight games and know this is a chance to narrow the deficit on their third-placed opponents to three points. Given the three steps forward one step back nature of this City team it would be no surprise if Ronald Koeman’s side departed with the spoils. Jamie Jackson
893,Leicester City,Manchester United,Fri 27 Nov 2015 15.04 GMT,2015-16,"Jamie Vardy could break a Premier League record by scoring in an 11th consecutive game against the very team that the current holder, Ruud van Nistelrooy, set the benchmark for 12 years ago. Louis van Gaal has described Vardy as a “nasty” problem for Manchester United and a “great” player but he will be just as wary of the threat posed by the in-form Riyad Mahrez. United have the meanest defence in the top flight so a repeat of last season’s 5-3 win for Leicester would appear unlikely. Rich Flower"
894,Tottenham Hotspur,Chelsea,Fri 27 Nov 2015 14.01 GMT,2015-16,"Tottenham Hotspur will attempt to extend the top flight’s longest current unbeaten run to 13 matches against the champions on Sunday, though they must shrug off a six-and-a-half-hour flight from Baku following Thursday’s win at Qarabag in the Europa League. There was little sympathy from José Mourinho for their plight, the Chelsea manager pointing to the unforgiving schedule around the Champions League semi-final against Atlético Madrid in 2014. In truth, the Portuguese has his own problems with John Terry and Ramires to be assessed on Saturday after picking up injuries in Israel in midweek. Dominic Fifield"
895,Bournemouth,Everton,Fri 27 Nov 2015 13.37 GMT,2015-16,"It is over two months since Bournemouth last won a league game – 2-0 against Sunderland – and they have not kept a clean sheet since. It leaves only Aston Villa beneath them in the table and with Chelsea and Manchester United after this another defeat could leave them in dire straits. Everton are big favourites to complete a south coast double having dismantled Southampton earlier in the season. Romelu Lukaku has seven goals from as many games and Roberto Martínez’s team have 11 in their last three, so expect goals. Alan Smith"
896,Sunderland,Stoke City,Fri 27 Nov 2015 13.03 GMT,2015-16,"Can Jack Butland break a club record set by Gordon Banks 45 years ago? By keeping clean sheets in Stoke’s past five away games in all competitions, the goalkeeper has already equalled it and now hopes to create a bit of history. With survival Sunderland’s sole concern, Sam Allardyce is expected to retain his new, opponent smothering, 3-5-2 formation. Considering Mark Hughes’s otherwise impressive team often struggle to score, the thrill factor could be on the low side. Louise Taylor"
897,Norwich City,Arsenal,Fri 27 Nov 2015 12.50 GMT,2015-16,"Arsenal’s away form in the Premier League has been good – nobody has taken more points than them – but, as last weekend’s crash at West Bromwich Albion showed, they remain prone to the odd nightmare. Mesut Özil and Alexis Sánchez were in top form as they bounced back to beat Dinamo Zagreb at home on Tuesday and they ought to have too much for a Norwich team that has endured a very difficult past two months. It is rarely that straightforward. David Hytner"
898,Watford,Manchester United,Fri 20 Nov 2015 18.07 GMT,2015-16,"Manchester United will go top for at least a couple of hours if they beat Watford, but they could be weighed down by problems in attack. Wayne Rooney, Anthony Martial and Marouane Fellaini are injured, while Louis van Gaal says that James Wilson is not ready to play 90 minutes, and United’s list of absentees will boost Watford’s hopes of pulling off a famous win. United’s defence will not relish the task of containing Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo. Jacob Steinberg"
899,Tottenham Hostpur,West Ham United,Fri 20 Nov 2015 17.56 GMT,2015-16,"It was difficult to recall a more imposing away-day performance from Tottenham than their display at Arsenal two weeks ago. Despite having less preparation time, the data showed they covered more ground and it said everything that they were disappointed with the 1-1 draw. Top-four belief has been fired and now they need a follow-up showing against West Ham who have excelled in big matches away from home. The visitors must find a way without their injured star, Dimitri Payet. David Hytner"
900,Swansea City,Bournemouth,Fri 20 Nov 2015 17.25 GMT,2015-16,"Garry Monk may have dismissed speculation about his position as Swansea’s manager as being generated by “outside influence” but if his side lose at home to Bournemouth, who are without a win in six league games, it will only increase the pressure. Monk, who has a fully-fit squad to choose from, may be suffering from the raised expectations generated by last season’s record points haul. Bournemouth have lacked a cutting edge since Callum Wilson’s serious knee injury and Eddie Howe needs Joshua King to fill the void in the attacking third. Rich Flower"
901,Crystal Palace,Sunderland,Fri 20 Nov 2015 17.13 GMT,2015-16,"On paper this fixture looks like a routine home win. After all, Crystal Palace come into it having beaten Liverpool at Anfield prior to the international break while Sunderland lost again, this time to Southampton. Sam Allardyce feels his team are “playing with fear” and he must hope memories of winning 3-1 at Selhurst Park last season can provide them with a shot of confidence. Sachin Nakrani"
902,Newcastle United,Leicester City,Fri 20 Nov 2015 16.58 GMT,2015-16,"Should Jamie Vardy pass a late fitness test and start for Leicester many Newcastle fans will probably feel like watching the striker’s expected duel with Fabricio Coloccini through their fingers. Small wonder Tynesiders are keeping everything crossed that Vardy’s extraordinary scoring streak is halted – temporarily at least – by the hip injury that leaves him touch and go for Saturday. With Leicester supreme on the counterattack, Claudio Ranieri aims to continue confounding the doubters but Steve McClaren is confident his Newcastle side are “turning a corner”. Louise Taylor"
903,Everton,Aston Villa,Fri 20 Nov 2015 16.38 GMT,2015-16,"Rémi Garde takes charge of his second game as Aston Villa manager and has had much more time to prepare than the three days before Villa’s draw with Manchester City. However, Garde’s inexperience in England could still show in his first away trip. Despite needing a victory Villa would be happy to leave Goodison with a point but Roberto Martínez will be expecting all three, especially after Everton’s 6-2 roasting of Sunderland. Graham Searles"
904,Southampton,Stoke City,Fri 20 Nov 2015 15.46 GMT,2015-16,"Southampton have lost just one of their past 10 league games and are seventh, just one point behind Tottenham in fifth. Ronald Koeman will have his work cut out against Stoke, though. Mark Hughes’s side have been much improved since Ryan Shawcross’s return, beating Chelsea before the international break at the Britannia Stadium. Jonathan Walters is fresh from firing Ireland into Euro 2016 and Hughes will hope he can reproduce that form on Saturday. Graham Searles"
905,Manchester City,Liverpool,Fri 20 Nov 2015 15.32 GMT,2015-16,"Sergio Agüero is available to start after nine matches out but this might be a contest where the Klopp factor has made an impact on Liverpool’s performance by the final whistle. A draw at the Etihad Stadium, which can be a graveyard for the very best sides, would be a fine result for Jürgen Klopp’s men. But City are flying, so for Manuel Pellegrini’s team only a win should satisfy. Jamie Jackson"
906,West Bromwich Albion,Arsenal,Fri 20 Nov 2015 14.38 GMT,2015-16,"Tony Pulis says the West Bromwich Albion job is the hardest of his career and pleaded for time to make the changes that he wants. But Albion fans are growing impatient with the negativity on display from their team so far this season. An enterprising performance and victory over Arsenal would be ideally timed, and Arsenal’s injury problems may help. But Arsène Wenger’s side have shown steel as well as style this season and it is difficult to see them slipping up at The Hawthorns. Paul Doyle"
907,Chelsea,Norwich City,Fri 20 Nov 2015 13.29 GMT,2015-16,"Norwich City’s encouraging victory over Swansea means Alex Neil’s side travel to Stamford Bridge above the ailing champions in the Premier League table. However it is 22 years since their last win at the ground, so they will still be braced for an awkward afternoon. José Mourinho has had a fortnight to stew over the loss at Stoke, a third league defeat in succession, which he watched from the team’s hotel. Still backed by the club’s hierarchy, who have promised to be even more supportive, he will be back on the touchline on Saturday seeking a reaction and a step forward on the road to recovery. Dominic Fifield"
908,Manchester United,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 6 Nov 2015 17.07 GMT,2015-16,"Perhaps the criticism of Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United as a still stodgy proposition is unfair. Football is a results business first and last and the manager is doing fine in this department. The club is re-established as a challenger for the Premier League, and they also lead their Champions League group, after the midweek win over CSKA Moscow. In last season’s corresponding fixture at Old Trafford, West Bromwich Albion beat United 1-0 so there should not be too many complaints if they win ugly. Again. Jamie Jackson"
909,Norwich City,Swansea City,Fri 6 Nov 2015 16.58 GMT,2015-16,"Norwich’s honeymoon period appears to be over and they may end up glad of the points amassed early on in the season. Defeat to Swansea would be their fifth in a row, but the Welsh side have won only one of their past seven so this would appear a good opportunity to start looking towards the mid-table positions once more. An injury to the in-form loanee Matt Jarvis is a particular blow to Alex Neil while the defence will be rejigged with the captain, Russell Martin, suspended. Nick Ames"
910,Aston Villa,Manchester City,Fri 6 Nov 2015 16.49 GMT,2015-16,"Welcome to the Premier League, Rémi Garde. Bottom versus top at Villa Park and, on the face of it, there looks to be only one result. City have won seven of their last eight in all competitions and Villa, on their worst run of defeats since 1963, have taken one point from a possible 30. Micah Richards will be back from suspension to face his former club, although it is another reunion, involving Fabian Delph and Villa, that will be much more eagerly anticipated. Stuart James"
911,Bournemouth,Newcastle United,Fri 6 Nov 2015 16.34 GMT,2015-16,"Both Eddie Howe and Steve McClaren candidly described the encounter as “very important” and a lot is to be gained on the south coast, maybe even three points for one of two sides who have found them hard to come by. The Bournemouth manager has urged his team to put on a true home performance – defeat for either side would leave them in the relegation zone over the international break. Ben Fisher"
912,Stoke City,Chelsea,Fri 6 Nov 2015 15.42 GMT,2015-16,"Rarely has a contest between the Premier League’s 14th and 15th placed sides been so fascinating. Will Chelsea build on Wednesday’s win against Dynamo Kyiv or will they suffer yet another damaging loss, and against a team who have already beaten them in the Capital One Cup this season? Whatever the case, José Mourinho will have to watch from afar because of his one-match stadium ban. Sachin Nakrani"
913,Leicester City,Watford,Fri 6 Nov 2015 15.36 GMT,2015-16,"Leicester City will join Arsenal and Manchester City at the top of the table if they beat Watford on Saturday afternoon and with Jamie Vardy two short of equalling Ruud van Nistelrooy’s record of scoring in 10 consecutive games, Claudio Ranieri’s side will be confident of victory. Yet Watford are on a two-game winning streak and have a potent striker of their own, Odion Ighalo, who has notched seven of their 10 goals. Jacob Steinberg"
914,Liverpool,Crystal Palace,Fri 6 Nov 2015 15.27 GMT,2015-16,"Jürgen Klopp’s tenure at Liverpool remains in its embryonic stage, but there are signs he is beginning to leave his mark. Certainly the defence appear more resilient – conceding just once in their past three games, all of which ended in victory. Klopp named a strong team for the trip to Rubin Kazan on Thursday, however, and Palace will be desperate to end a run of three matches without a win. Alan Smith"
915,West Ham United,Everton,Fri 6 Nov 2015 14.42 GMT,2015-16,"Everton have not lost to West Ham in 14 league games but the manager, Slaven Bilic, a £4.5m former Blue and no friend of the fans after his scratchy, injury-strewn service in the late 90s and insistence on taking a payoff before signing for Hajduk Split a few days later, is well placed do his old club another disservice. Romelu Lukaku is Everton’s best hope, with six goals in six against the Hammers. Mark Tallentire"
916,Arsenal,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 6 Nov 2015 13.14 GMT,2015-16,"Victory in the north London derby would be an ideal way for Arsenal to get over their midweek humiliation in the Champions League and reassert their title-wining credentials but they will have to excel to achieve such a result. Tottenham arrive in fine form and bolstered by the return of Son Heung-min, while Arsenal’s injury list remains long with seven players definitely out and three more doubtful. Paul Doyle"
917,Sunderland,Southampton,Fri 6 Nov 2015 13.02 GMT,2015-16,"Sam Allardyce is expected to abandon the three at the back formation so badly exposed in the 6-2 reverse at Everton last Sunday. That system failure increases the pressure on Sunderland to register what would be only their second Premier League win of the season at Southampton’s expense. It will not be easy, particularly as dispensing with 3-5-2 could leave the home manager struggling to accommodate both his key strikers, Steven Fletcher and Jermain Defoe. “It’s a dilemma, said Allardyce. Louise Taylor"
918,Manchester City,Norwich City,Fri 30 Oct 2015 17.26 GMT,2015-16,"Manchester City have not lost since going down at Tottenham Hotspur on 26 September. They have scored 18 goals in their six games in all competitions since, five of which have been won. Manuel Pellegrini’s side are once more flying as they were before that 4-1 defeat to Spurs. Norwich City are not – they last enjoyed victory on 23 September and have lost their past three Premier League matches. There is, then, surely only one winner at the Etihad Stadium on Saturday afternoon. Jamie Jackson"
919,Swansea City,Arsenal,Fri 30 Oct 2015 17.13 GMT,2015-16,"The true cost of Tuesday’s Capital One Cup exit to Sheffield Wednesday will perhaps be seen on Saturday as Arsenal, without the injured Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain and Theo Walcott, face a Swansea side who beat them home and away last season. Swansea’s Garry Monk has no such worries with his full squad available, but is hoping to improve on a run of one win in their past six league games. Paul Chronnell"
920,West Bromwich Albion,Leicester City,Fri 30 Oct 2015 16.23 GMT,2015-16,"Albion entered the top half of the table thanks to consecutive 1-0 wins against Sunderland and Norwich but a resilient defence will face a different test in Jamie Vardy, whose 10 goals from 10 make him the Premier League’s top marksman. His relationship with Riyad Mahrez has been one of the season’s great joys so far. Claudio Ranieri, the Leicester manager, made 10 changes for the penalty shootout defeat to Hull in the League Cup but could name the same team that beat Crystal Palace in last weekend’s league game. Alan Smith"
921,Crystal Palace,Manchester United,Fri 30 Oct 2015 16.09 GMT,2015-16,"Even Louis van Gaal could not explain how United won this fixture last season, the 2-1 smash-and-grab having been coloured by off-colour football. United’s no-thrills style remains a bone of contention, although not to Van Gaal. “Sticks and stones,” he says of the criticism. It is the results that matter and United, he argues, are improving. “United lull the stadium and take the positivity out of it by keeping possession,” Alan Pardew said. The Palace manager meant away stadiums. David Hytner"
922,Tottenham Hotspur,Aston Villa,Fri 30 Oct 2015 16.01 GMT,2015-16,"What Aston Villa would not give for a repeat of April’s victory at White Hart Lane. That had been overseen by Tim Sherwood whose sacking last Sunday, while Spurs were running riot at Bournemouth, had the ring of grim inevitability about it. The problems at the Midlands club run deeper than the identity of those in the dugout, but they must now attempt to halt a run of six successive league defeats. Tottenham, with Harry Kane and Christian Eriksen running into form, are unbeaten in the division since the opening weekend and will be daunting opponents. Dominic Fifield"
923,Southampton,Bournemouth,Fri 30 Oct 2015 15.17 GMT,2015-16,Bournemouth have shipped 10 goals in their past two Premier League games and Eddie Howe will be keen to avoid any more of the defensive disasters that left the Cherries red-faced against Tottenham last Sunday. This is the first ever top-flight meeting between these south coast neighbours and Southampton enter in decent form having been defeated only once in nine matches. Bournemouth have never won at Southampton and considering their injury list will not be fancied to change that. Alan Smith
924,Everton,Sunderland,Fri 30 Oct 2015 14.18 GMT,2015-16,"Victory in the Tyne-Wear derby is not the only cause of optimism for Sam Allardyce as he heads to Goodison Park. With Phil Jagielka sidelined with a knee injury and Séamus Coleman expected to miss out with a stomach bug, Everton are likely to field a back four boasting a collective total of only 62 Premier League starts – 46 of which belong to John Stones. Roberto Martínez’s team have not won a league game this month and an encouraging start to the campaign has stalled. Andy Hunter"
925,Newcastle United,Stoke City,Fri 30 Oct 2015 14.09 GMT,2015-16,"The 3-0 derby defeat to Sunderland was quite harsh on Newcastle considering their dominance before Fabricio Coloccini was sent off for conceding a penalty from which they fell a goal behind. The captain is available here after that red card was rescinded but Steve McClaren’s team will not find it easy against Stoke, who will be buoyed by beating Chelsea on penalties in midweek and with five wins from their past six in all competitions. Alan Smith"
926,Chelsea,Liverpool,Fri 30 Oct 2015 14.04 GMT,2015-16,"Liverpool might privately consider this an opportunity to gain revenge over all things José Mourinho. Forget for a moment the antipathy which grew between the clubs during the Portuguese’s first spell in England: since he returned to Chelsea in 2013 there has been that Steven Gerrard slip at Anfield and an acrimonious League Cup semi-final at Stamford Bridge. Now the hosts appear vulnerable, languishing in 15th place with pressure mounting on the manager. Jürgen Klopp, bolstered by a first win at his new club in midweek, could lay down a marker in south-west London at Mourinho’s expense. Dominic Fifield"
927,Watford,West Ham United,Fri 30 Oct 2015 12.42 GMT,2015-16,"West Ham have the division’s finest record against the division’s finest teams, with four wins in five games against sides currently in the top half of the table, but even including last week’s home victory over Chelsea they are unexceptional against the rest, and have taken just one point from two games against last season’s promotees. Watford, buoyed by a convincing win at Stoke and the possible return from injury of José Manuel Jurado, hope to prolong the Hammers’ record of upside-down achievement. Simon Burnton"
928,Bournemouth,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 23 Oct 2015 17.40 BST,2015-16,"Tottenham Hotspur make only their second visit to Bournemouth – their other was a 3-1 FA Cup defeat back in 1957 – seeking a recovery after one win in six matches in all competitions. That said, they are unbeaten in the Premier League since the opening day. Yet, given the visitors’ venture to Brussels on Thursday in the Europa League, these are the fixtures Bournemouth should target as an opportunity. The last few weeks, as the implications of long-term injuries are felt, have been damaging. Eddie Howe will hope this occasion will revitalise his own side’s challenge. Dominic Fifield"
929,Arsenal,Everton,Fri 23 Oct 2015 17.20 BST,2015-16,"After a week to remember, Arsenal fans must know a brush with reality could be just around the corner. But having ended Bayern Munich’s 100% start to the season on Tuesday, even the most pessimistic supporters must be confident. Roberto Martínez’s side are not Bayern, although they will be looking for a response having been soundly beaten by Manchester United last Saturday and could make their opponents pay if any complacency creeps in. Ed Aarons"
930,Manchester United,Manchester city,Fri 23 Oct 2015 17.08 BST,2015-16,"The all-time goal tally in the 169 previous derbies stands at 249-234 to United with City winning 49 times to their rivals’ 70. If Manuel Pellegrini can earn a 50th victory for City their lead over United will stretch to five points and a significant psychological blow will have been dealt. But with David Silva and Sergio Agüero out and Louis van Gaal’s side playing at home, United are surely favourites despite the manager’s protestations to the contrary. Jamie Jackson"
931,Liverpool,Southampton,Fri 23 Oct 2015 16.57 BST,2015-16,"After a week full of firsts Jürgen Klopp will manage his first league game at Anfield and will want his players to perform much better than in his midweek home debut against Rubin Kazan on Thursday. While Ronald Koeman will share the German’s sentiments after his Southampton side spurned a 2-0 lead at Leicester last Saturday, with a visit to Chelsea next weekend it is Klopp who needs to find the winning habit. Graham Searles"
932,Norwich City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 23 Oct 2015 16.29 BST,2015-16,"Norwich City’s top-flight return had been progressing much as expected, with nine points from eight games, until last Sunday’s 6-2 reverse at previously winless Newcastle. That defensive horror show would have given City’s manager, Alex Neil, a long week, even if Saturday’s visitors were beaten 3-0 in the Capital One Cup last month. Tony Pulis’s side are unlikely to be as charitable again. Paul Chronnell"
933,Aston Villa,Swansea City,Fri 23 Oct 2015 16.16 BST,2015-16,"Make or break time for Tim Sherwood. After five successive league defeats, the Villa manager runs the risk of being out of a job if that run stretches to six. In the opposite dugout is Garry Monk, who was on the same FAW Uefa pro licence course as Sherwood and could do with a win himself – Swansea have not tasted victory since beating Man Utd at the end of August. Both managers have the privilege of fully fit squads to choose from. Stuart James"
934,Stoke City,Watford,Fri 23 Oct 2015 15.43 BST,2015-16,"Watford travel to Stoke with the ignominious title of being the lowest scorers in the league having only managed six goals in nine games. Despite being comparatively strong in defence, Quique Sánchez Flores’s side could struggle against Stoke who are building up a quiet head of steam after Monday’s win at Swansea. If victorious on Saturday Stoke should move into the top half of the table. Graham Searles"
935,Leicester City,Crystal Palace,Fri 23 Oct 2015 15.22 BST,2015-16,"Jamie Vardy’s fine season continued when he rescued Leicester with two goals at Southampton last Saturday and if he scores again on Saturday he will become only the sixth striker – Alan Shearer, Thierry Henry, Emmanuel Adebayor, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Daniel Sturridge are the others – to have found the net in seven successive Premier League games. Palace will miss their suspended striker, Dwight Gayle, but will be keen to bounce back after their disappointing home defeat to West Ham last Saturday. Graham Searles"
936,West Ham United,Chelsea,Fri 23 Oct 2015 14.12 BST,2015-16,"Slowly, but perhaps not that surely, signs of the old Chelsea are emerging. The champions have relieved the pressure on them in the past week, beating Aston Villa 2-0 last Saturday and drawing 0-0 at Dynamo Kyiv on Tuesday. Two clean sheets have boosted confidence at the back. Yet the visit to Upton Park could be awkward for José Mourinho. West Ham are fourth and Slaven Bilic’s side have already beaten Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City. Jacob Steinberg"
937,Sunderland,Newcastle United,Fri 23 Oct 2015 12.00 BST,2015-16,"Sam Allardyce is the fourth successive Sunderland manager to face Newcastle in his second game in charge. He aims to secure not only the Wearsiders’ sixth straight win against their neighbours but also his side’s first league victory of the season. Standing in the way are Steve McClaren’s visiting team, fresh from demolishing Norwich 6-2. Much may hinge on a feisty looking central midfield battle potentially pitting Yann M’Vila and Lee Cattermole against Cheik Tioté and Sunderland old boy Jack Colback. Louise Taylor"

The focus is now drawn to the visit of Aston Villa as the latest opportunity to kickstart a campaign. Tim Sherwood arrives with his own problems, and tension mounting behind the scenes with his job apparently in jeopardy.

Xherdan Shaqiri has shaken off a thigh strain but the game has come too soon for Ryan Shawcross and Stoke will also be without Mame Biram Diouf, who is on compassionate leave following the death of his mother.

947,Newcastle United,Norwich City,Fri 16 Oct 2015 13.08 BST,2015-16,"If this is a big game for Steve McClaren and Newcastle, it is a pretty significant fixture for Norwich too. Alex Neil’s promoted team have not won in the league for a month now and they would be disappointed not to exacerbate the Tyneside misery surrounding Newcastle’s worst start to a season for 117 years. McClaren is desperate to register a first top-flight victory but could have done without needing to field Rob Elliot, his third-choice goalkeeper, after Tim Krul’s season-ending knee injury.

As injuries stack up for Eddie Howe, the spotlight will turn to Glenn Murray, the former Crystal Palace forward, to fill the void left by Wilson. Bournemouth supporters will switch their attentions to Mick Cunningham after 55 minutes, in which they will start a minute’s applause in memory of the former club photographer, who collapsed whilst at work during the first half at Stoke. The Hornets ought to know what to expect on the south coast, having duelled with the Cherries for the Championship title last year.

Re-energised and remodelled under Slaven Bilic, West Ham appear awkward opponents, and locals will dread the prospect of their old enemy Andy Carroll stepping off the bench and scoring the winner. Louise Taylor"
951,Manchester City,Newcastle United,Fri 2 Oct 2015 17.24 BST,2015-16,"Manchester City have not registered a Premier League victory for three weeks and will be looking to end that run when Newcastle arrive at the Etihad Stadium. Steve McClaren’s side will be boosted by their 2-2 draw with Chelsea last time out at St James’ Park. But the way the Magpies sacrificed a 2-0 lead will have been noted, the Sky Blues will hope to prey on this fragility. Jamie Jackson"
952,Chelsea,Southampton,Fri 2 Oct 2015 17.10 BST,2015-16,"Chelsea’s malaise appears unending. They lost to Porto in midweek, have a manager who can’t stop picking fights with practically everyone at the club and remain without their star striker in Diego Costa. The visitors arrive fresh from beating Swansea 3-1 and should feel they can add to the champions’ woes by recording their first win at Stamford Bridge since January 2002. Sachin Nakrani"
953,Swansea City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 2 Oct 2015 16.20 BST,2015-16,"Tottenham are on a great run having won their last three league games and will be confident of inflicting more pain on faltering Swansea who conversely have one point from their last three games. Tottenham, however, are without their influential summer signing Son Heung-min and could struggle if Swansea come out of their slump and play their usual brand of possession football. Graham Searles"
954,Aston Villa,Stoke City,Fri 2 Oct 2015 15.58 BST,2015-16,"Tim Sherwood began life at Villa Park with a defeat at home to Stoke City back in March and although he recovered from that setback, it is beginning to look like another season of struggle for Aston Villa, who have picked up one point since winning on the opening day. This is a huge game. Villa are 18th and Stoke, who got their first win of the season last week, are two points above them. Jacob Steinberg"
955,Arsenal,Manchester United,Fri 2 Oct 2015 15.37 BST,2015-16,"Arsenal and United will both start without key defenders but it is United who have looked much more convincing when fielding a weakened backline. Arsenal suffered once more in the Champions League in midweek and will be looking to recover immediately through the ever-dangerous Alexis Sánchez. Per Mertesacker’s rustiness, however, could prove fatal for the Gunners’ chances. Graham Searles"
956,Norwich City,Leicester City,Fri 2 Oct 2015 14.55 BST,2015-16,"Norwich City have lost only once since the opening day and it is a mark of their quick readjustment to Premier League life that they came away from trips to Liverpool and West Ham Utd feeling that they could, and in the latter case, should have won. Now the aim is to put a run of home wins together; Bournemouth were beaten at Carrow Road last month and the outcome of Saturday’s match may hinge on how Leicester City respond to Arsenal’s emphatic bursting of their bubble last Saturday. Two attack-minded teams should produce a high-tempo, if at times untidy, spectacle. Nick Ames"
957,Everton,Liverpool,Fri 2 Oct 2015 13.54 BST,2015-16,"One point separates the Merseyside rivals in the table but a gulf exists between the managers in terms of the pressure they are under, with Brendan Rodgers claiming there was a hysteria around him last Saturday and this fixture ensures there is no release. Rodgers has not lost a derby at Goodison Park and Daniel Sturridge’s return should improve Liverpool’s finishing. Roberto Martínez’s side, however, look far more mature this season with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku improving. Andy Hunter"
958,Stoke City,Bournemouth,Fri 25 Sep 2015 18.27 BST,2015-16,"Stoke have endured a surprisingly poor start to the season after many predicted bright things from Mark Hughes’s side following some eye-catching summer transfers. Before the start of the campaign a home game against Bournemouth would have been seen as an ideal opportunity to get back on course but the newly promoted side have proven anything but a pushover so far despite the loss of two of their biggest signings, Max Gradel and Tyrone Mings, to long-term injuries. Rich Flower"
959,Newcastle United,Chelsea,Fri 25 Sep 2015 18.09 BST,2015-16,"Loïc Rémy is expected to start for Chelsea against the club where he enjoyed a fruitful loan spell in 2013-14 as Diego Costa continues his suspension following last week’s contretemps against Arsenal. Newcastle’s beleaguered manager, Steve McClaren, would dearly love to have Rémy available to him as his side continue to struggle for goals, a situation not helped by Papiss Cissé’s injury. Aleksandar Mitrovic is back after a ban of his own and will lead the home attack in place of Cissé – if the fiesty Serb can keep his temper under control, he has the potential talent to ease the pressure on McClaren. Rich Flower"
960,Leicester City,Arsenal,Fri 25 Sep 2015 17.40 BST,2015-16,"To bet that Leicester City would be the Premier League’s only unbeaten side come the last weekend in September would have found fairly reasonable odds seven weeks ago, but Claudio Ranieri’s dynamic team have enjoyed confounding the critics thus far. Arsenal arrive buoyed by a midweek Capital One Cup win at Tottenham, but five goals in six league games is a record that needs improving. Paul Chronnell"
961,Manchester United,Sunderland,Fri 25 Sep 2015 17.02 BST,2015-16,"Manchester United can go top if Manchester City lose at Tottenham Hotspur in the day’s early match, and they defeat Dick Advocaat’s side. Anthony Martial may make his second Premier League start as the 19-year-old striker looks for a fifth goal in five appearances for the club. Sunderland are bottom with two points, zero victories and have conceded 13 goals while scoring six. United, then, should record their fifth win of the term. Jamie Jackson"
962,Watford,Crystal Palace,Fri 25 Sep 2015 16.31 BST,2015-16,"Palace have won five and lost just one of their past nine visits to Vicarage Road in the league, last played Watford at Wembley two years ago on the day they sealed their Premier League place, and perhaps most pertinently, have won two of their three away games this season. But they have lost their past two in the league, while Watford have won theirs. Alan Pardew has admitted the Hornets “have handled the division very well” thus far, adding that “I’ve always liked them” and “I’m a big fan of Elton John”. Simon Burnton"
963,Tottenham Hotspur,Manchester City,Fri 25 Sep 2015 15.14 BST,2015-16,"Mauricio Pochettino goes a long way back with Manuel Pellegrini. The Tottenham manager was a youth international for Argentina at the South America Under-20 Championship in 1991 when he remembers scoring the winning goal in a group phase tie against a Chile team managed by Pellegrini. What Pochettino would give for a repeat scoreline against Manchester City on Saturday. Tottenham are battling to ally fluency with results while City – and Sergio Agüero, in particular – have been their nemesis in recent times. David Hytner"
964,West Bromwich Albion,Everton,Fri 25 Sep 2015 14.54 BST,2015-16,"Both clubs have already benefited this season from their hardline stances over Saido Berahino and John Stones and the pair may be influential to their team’s chances at The Hawthorns, providing the Everton defender recovers from a knee injury in time. Tony Pulis has had notable success in stifling Roberto Martínez’s tactics in the past and the Everton manager believes his team are facing “one of the best defensive units in the Premier League”. Everton’s defensive record is not too shabby away from home this season – they are yet to concede on the road in the Premier League. Andy Hunter"
965,West Ham United,Norwich City,Fri 25 Sep 2015 13.36 BST,2015-16,"West Ham’s history makers, having sprung surprise wins at Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester City, face a different pressure against Norwich on the basis they are expected to win. They were favourites in both defeats this season, against Leicester and Bournemouth, and have thus far revelled when the underdog. Saturday’s visitors have a dour away record in the top flight, winning only one of their past 14 on the road, but have only been defeated at Southampton since Alex Neil took charge and drew at Anfield last weekend. Alan Smith"
966,Southampton,Swansea City,Fri 25 Sep 2015 13.15 BST,2015-16,"Southampton have not fully regained their defensive solidity of last season – Ryan Bertrand’s return will help that – but they have found their groove offensively, unlike Swansea, whose strong start to the season has stalled a little as they have failed to find the net in their past three matches. Both sides will feel that a win here could kick-start the season and get them back on track for another high finish. Paul Doyle"
967,Liverpool,Aston Villa,Fri 25 Sep 2015 13.00 BST,2015-16,"Brendan Rodgers needs a win more than he has ever done in his time at Liverpool. The besieged manager accepts he is in a precarious position after an alarming spell and not even the visit of a team who have four defeats from five league games offers encouragement. Aston Villa have won two and drawn two of their past four visits to Anfield, accelerated Liverpool’s problems last season with victory in the FA Cup semi-final and have clear anxiety to capitalise upon. Rodgers’ injury problems have mounted with Christian Benteke, Roberto Firmino and Dejan Lovren joining the absentee list this week. Andy Hunter"
968,Tottenham Hotspur,Arsenal,Tue 22 Sep 2015 18.11 BST,2015-16,"Injuries to Nabil Bentaleb, Mousa Dembélé and Ryan Mason have deprived Tottenham of three midfielders for the Capital One Cup third-round meeting with Arsenal. Mauricio Pochettino can take heart from the fact that Arsenal are scarcely in better shape themselves, although Arsène Wenger is optimistic Francis Coquelin will not be a long-term absentee. “His knee is swollen but we hope it is just a short-term problem,” the Arsenal manager said. Rich Flower"
969,Southampton,Manchester United,Fri 18 Sep 2015 21.03 BST,2015-16,"Southampton have shown signs in recent weeks of regaining the defensive solidity of last season, while the injury to Luke Shaw means that United have some defensive reorganising to do, with either Daley Blind or Marcos Rojo likely to be deployed at left-back instead. Whichever one gets the job is likely to be tested by Sadio Mané and Dusan Tadic – pass that test and United will stand a strong chance of gaining three points at St Mary’s for the second successive season in a row after last term’s slightly fortunate victory. Paul Doyle"
970,Aston Villa,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 18 Sep 2015 19.36 BST,2015-16,"Tim Sherwood said losing to Leicester City last week was a new low but that might be nothing compared to suffering defeats in their next two derbies, this fixture followed by the midweek League Cup game against Birmingham City. It is important, though, especially with local rivals West Brom arriving without showing a hint of attacking threat against Southampton last week. Alan Smith"
971,Stoke City,Leicester City,Fri 18 Sep 2015 19.29 BST,2015-16,"Following the giddiness brought by their impressive summer signings, the season has not quite started as planned for Stoke, yet there is no sense of panic despite being winless. When will Leicester’s surge slow? Claudio Ranieri’s side continued their fine start by coming from 2-0 down to beat Aston Villa and will be confident on Saturday. Last year’s meetings were both decided by a single goal. Alan Smith"
972,Swansea City,Everton,Fri 18 Sep 2015 19.26 BST,2015-16,"For all the early-season promise shown by Everton’s front pairing of Arouna Koné and Romelu Lukaku, it was Steven Naismith who scored three goals against Chelsea and it seems inconceivable that he will not start at the Liberty Stadium. With a fully fit squad to choose from, Garry Monk will be hoping to put last week’s reverse at the hands of Watford behind the Swans. Barry Glendenning"
973,Tottenham Hotspur,Crystal Palace,Fri 18 Sep 2015 18.50 BST,2015-16,"There have not been too many occasions that Tottenham have met their rivals from south of the river trailing them in the table but that is the scenario Mauricio Pochettino faces here. Victory in the Europa League will at least have given Spurs some confidence after drawing their first two games of the season at home, although Palace have been outstanding on the road under Alan Pardew and will fancy their chances of a ninth away win in 11 since he joined the club in January. Ed Aarons"
974,Manchester City,West Ham United,Fri 18 Sep 2015 18.20 BST,2015-16,"Manchester City may have gone down to Juventus in Tuesday’s Champions League group game but they still have a perfect Premier League record. Five wins, five clean sheets, 11 goals and 15 points means West Ham United will be wary on arrival at the Etihad Stadium. Yet Slaven Bilic’s team have already defeated Arsenal (2-0) and Liverpool (3-0) on their travels so it could be a tough afternoon for the hosts. Jamie Jackson"
975,Chelsea,Arsenal,Fri 18 Sep 2015 17.47 BST,2015-16,"This may be the kind of fixture Chelsea need to kickstart their title defence. These sides had contrasting fortunes in the Champions League in midweek and, while Arsenal will arrive with Petr Cech in their ranks and last month’s success in the Community Shield to bolster confidence, José Mourinho will spy an opportunity. His side breezed beyond Maccabi Tel Aviv with his players finally finding some upbeat rhythm, while Arsenal only returned home from Zagreb as dawn approached on Thursday. The hosts have awkward decisions to make over John Terry and Branislav Ivanovic, but Mourinho will be confident his team will be more recognisable as reigning champions. Dominic Fifield"
976,Bournemouth,Sunderland,Fri 18 Sep 2015 15.55 BST,2015-16,"It is back to reality and back to basics for Eddie Howe’s Bournemouth. Despite having earned praise for their handsome approach, they are still without a home win or a clean sheet in the Premier League and were humbled 3-1 by fellow promoted side Norwich at Carrow Road last weekend. Sunderland have only two points from five games but will doubtless take confidence from their display in the narrow 1-0 defeat at Tottenham. Ben Fisher"
977,Newcastle United,Watford,Fri 18 Sep 2015 15.54 BST,2015-16,"Bottom of the league, without a win and with only two goals scored, Newcastle are still a little way from full-on “crisis mode” but Steve McClaren could seriously do with a victory against Watford. A combination of some encouraging performances and a set of tough opening fixtures have, so far, kept the fans on the new manager’s side, but the defeat at West Ham looked a return to last season’s bad old ways. Another stumble could see Gallowgate Enders struggling to keep the faith. Louise Taylor"
978,Liverpool,Norwich City,Fri 18 Sep 2015 14.17 BST,2015-16,"Norwich represent the first of four consecutive inviting home games for Liverpool that will be as much a test of Anfield’s support for Brendan Rodgers as his ability to produce a winning, cohesive team. Liverpool have been prolific in this fixture in recent years, scoring five in three of the past four meetings, but that was when Luis Suárez was destroying them. Alex Neil’s team may now also be a different proposition. Defeat at Southampton last month was Norwich’s first in 15 away games under the Scot.Andy Hunter"
979,Chelsea,Maccabi Tel Aviv,Tue 15 Sep 2015 22.30 BST,2015-16,"While most would expect Chelsea to make short work of the Israeli champions, that is possibly what most of their opponents in the qualifying rounds thought, and it did not quite turn out that way. Slavisa Jokanovic, formerly of Chelsea, oversaw wins over Hibernians, the Czechs of Viktoria Plzen and then, most impressively, the Swiss side Basel, to reach the group stages for the first time in 11 years. José Mourinho, whose European campaign ended so disappointingly with the exit to PSG six months ago, is without a number of regulars and knows the morale-boosting victory he needs to take into Saturday’s league meeting with Arsenal cannot be taken for granted. Paul Chronnell"
980,Dinamo Zagreb,Arsenal,Tue 15 Sep 2015 22.30 BST,2015-16,"Some Arsenal fans might baulk at their failure to progress beyond the … of the Champions League, but they are dab hands in this tournament compared to their Croatian hosts who take part in the group stage for only the fourth time and first in three years. Arsène Wenger’s team made the trip without their three long-term absentees – Jack Wilshere, Tomas Rosicky and Danny Welbeck – but will be expecting to make a winning start in a group that also contains Olympiacos and regular adversaries Bayern Munich. Alan Smith"
981,Manchester City,Juventus,Tue 15 Sep 2015 11.21 BST,2015-16,"The changes in the seeding system for Champions League groups was thought to favour Manchester City, who had always suffered from their relatively low coefficient under the old rules and ended up with tough sections on each occasion."
982,PSV Eindhoven,Manchester United,Mon 14 Sep 2015 20.34 BST,2015-16,"On the last occasion Manchester United played a Champions League match the final scraps of any David Moyes success were swept away by a rampant Bayern Munich in 17 harrowing minutes. United are back but a lot has changed in the intervening 18 months and this competition will provide a measure for progress under Louis van Gaal. In a group which lacks an obvious punchbag, United face three potentially treacherous trips abroad. A positive start against PSV, who arrive on the back of a 6-0 thrashing of lowly Eredivisie side Cambuur on Saturday, would go a long way to settling nerves on their return to Europe’s elite. Lawrence Ostlere"
983,Arsenal,Stoke City,Fri 11 Sep 2015 18.32 BST,2015-16,Arsenal have endured difficulties in away games against Stoke City but things have tended to be rather smoother for them at home. They have won the past 13 meetings in north London and Stoke must go back to 1981 for their last victory. Arsenal need a continuation of the normal order after drawing blanks in both of their home games so far this season. Stoke are carrying a few injuries and suspensions but they travel with confidence. David Hytner
984,West Ham United,Newcastle United,Fri 11 Sep 2015 17.37 BST,2015-16,"A fixture that might send shivers of apprehension down Steve McClaren’s spine, with memories of his England team subsiding against Slaven Bilic’s Croatia back in 2007 flooding back. Heaven forbid it rains on Monday night. “But I had sympathy for Steve because I know how it works,” said Bilic. “That wasn’t just a normal game, but he has recovered really well.” His Newcastle await a first win since his return to the Premier League though West Ham’s unpredictability, without a home point to date under Bilic, may work in their favour. Just to add to the intrigue, the hosts may have Andy Carroll back in the squad after injury. Dominic Fifield"
985,Sunderland,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 11 Sep 2015 17.17 BST,2015-16,"Jermain Defoe would relish jogging a few memories by scoring against his old club but he must do so from a wide role, Dick Advocaat having made it abundantly clear he will not deploy him in a central attacking capacity. That job is now earmarked for Fabio Borini. Newly returned to Sunderland following his £7m move from Liverpool, Borini is already “feeling the love” from fans. Considerably less warmth will be directed towards Advocaat’s defence should Spurs start enjoying themselves. Louise Taylor"
986,West Bromwich Albion,Southampton,Fri 11 Sep 2015 17.16 BST,2015-16,"These are curious times for both Tony Pulis and Ronald Koeman. The West Brom manager, Pulis, has watched his team stutter minus their star striker, Saido Berahino, who may feature here, while his Southampton counterpart, Koeman, will have been relieved that they ended a worrying start with a convincing win over Norwich before the international break. Expect a tight contest. Alan Smith"
987,Crystal Palace,Manchester City,Fri 11 Sep 2015 17.12 BST,2015-16,"Saturday, 29 August at the Veterans Memorial auditorium in Providence, Rhode Island and Eddie Izzard has launched into one of his trademark rambling monologues. The subject matter has meandered on to the Crusades when the Crystal Palace associate director interjects: “… and then, in the second half, on came Bolasie and Palace ended up winning 2-1 to go second in the table.” Chelsea were beaten last time out. Now Alan Pardew’s side aim to repeat April’s victory over Manchester chesterCity, the only side above them in the fledgling table. Izzard will be performing at the the Mountain Winery in Saratoga on Saturday night. He will hope he has further tweaks to make to his routine. Dominic Fifield"
988,Everton,Chelsea,Fri 11 Sep 2015 16.43 BST,2015-16,"The focus will be on John Stones but not at the end of the game should Chelsea falter once more. The reigning champions are eight points adrift of Manchester City with four games gone and are still searching for the confidence, form and power that contributed to a 6-3 win here early last season. Everton’s injury problems at left-back, where the new £9.5m signing Ramiro Funes Mori may have to make his debut out of position, could be exploited. Andy Hunter"
989,Manchester United,Liverpool,Fri 11 Sep 2015 16.39 BST,2015-16,"David de Gea has signed a new four-year deal and Louis van Gaal has admitted Wayne Rooney and Michael Carrick (bravely) informed him the dressing room is “flat”. The latest seismic week at Manchester United ends with the visit of Liverpool. These firmest of enemies each have seven points and would love to end Saturday’s late game with three more and bragging rights for their supporters. Last season, Van Gaal’s team gave Liverpool a 3-0 schooling in the corresponding fixture. This time it may be closer. Jamie Jackson"
990,Leicester City,Aston Villa,Fri 11 Sep 2015 16.34 BST,2015-16,"Last season’s edition of this Midlands derby had real niggle so both sets of players will need to be ready to be plunged straight back into Premier League mode after the international breaks. Gökhan Inler’s performance for Switzerland against England in midweek may have convinced Claudio Ranieri that the midfielder is ready for his first start since joining in the summer, but the manager will mostly be looking for more of the same from a side who have made a strong start to the season. Villa will have to improve to avoid defeat. Paul Doyle"
991,Watford,Swansea City,Fri 11 Sep 2015 16.09 BST,2015-16,"Their performances have been adequate, suffering only one defeat from their four games, but Watford will be desperate to get that first win since promotion under their belts. That appears quite a challenge against Swansea, who were triumphant against Manchester United before the international break and are led by the increasingly impressive and influential Bafétimbi Gomis. Alan Smith"
992,Norwich City,Bournemouth,Fri 11 Sep 2015 15.57 BST,2015-16,"Norwich seek a first home win of what, on paper, has been a relatively kind early run. They do so without the suspended Steven Whittaker, who is likely to be replaced by Andre Wisdom, but welcome Dieumerci Mbokani and Matthew Jarvis into the fold. The former, at least, is likely to start on the bench through a lack of match fitness. Lewis Grabban could return to the squad after a club suspension. Bournemouth must regroup after the long-term injuries suffered by expensive signings Tyrone Mings and Max Gradel before the international break. Nick Ames"
993,Stoke City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 28 Aug 2015 18.32 BST,2015-16,Stoke City and West Brom have made disappointing starts to their seasons with neither side yet winning a game. This will be anything but a classic. Stoke look like the more settled side of the two and on paper have the edge in attack over West Brom. However Tony Pulis will be highly motivated against his former club and will be hoping his players can rebut criticism of their early form. Graham Searles
994,Aston Villa,Sunderland,Fri 28 Aug 2015 18.11 BST,2015-16,"Sunderland have made a dismal start to the season and the three goals they conceded against Exeter in the League Cup highlighted the need for improvement. Aston Villa had their own scare against lower division opposition in midweek and have been inconsistent, but even in the games they have lost, they have been competitive. Rudy Gestede should be able to bully Sunderland’s fragile defence and create chances for himself and fellow attackers. Graham Searles"
995,Newcastle United,Arsenal,Fri 28 Aug 2015 17.57 BST,2015-16,"Steve McClaren hopes Moussa Sissoko will make the team sheet after recovering from groin trouble. Admired by, among others, Arsène Wenger, Sissoko appears destined to remain on Tyneside. Having invested nearly £50m in players during this window Newcastle are adamant they have no intention of selling any key players. “We don’t need to sell and we don’t want to sell,” said McClaren who may offer a League debut to one time Arsenal target Florian Thauvin. The former Marseille winger shone against Northampton in midweek. Louise Taylor"
996,Swansea City,Manchester United,Fri 28 Aug 2015 17.36 BST,2015-16,"Swansea did the double over United last season and have started well, with Bafétimbi Gomis scoring in the opening three league matches and Jefferson Montero catching the eye on the left wing. United cut loose against Club Brugge on Wednesday when Wayne Rooney scored a hat-trick but their domestic form has been unconvincing, with one positive being the three clean sheets Sergio Romero has kept in goal. Stuart James"
997,Southampton,Norwich City,Fri 28 Aug 2015 17.15 BST,2015-16,Norwich have four points from their first three games and Alex Neil will be looking to capitalise on Southampton’s Europa League exit in midweek by piling on more misery for Ronald Koeman. The Saints manager will be hoping his players’ focus will have been sharpened by the defeat and that it spurs them on to their first league victory of the season. Graham Searles
998,Tottenham Hotspur,Everton,Fri 28 Aug 2015 16.38 BST,2015-16,"The signing of the forward Son Heung-min will raise spirits but Tottenham still do not look well enough equipped to improve on last season’s fifth place and could struggle to get their first win this season against an Everton team who look to have more power and creativity. Spurs will need to defend brilliantly for the whole match for a change to keep the visitors at bay, with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku in dangerous form. Paul Doyle"
999,Manchester City,Watford,Fri 28 Aug 2015 16.17 BST,2015-16,"Manuel Pellegrini is keen Manchester City take Watford seriously and given the ruthless way they have started the campaign that is highly likely. Nine points, eight goals scored, and none allowed from the first three matches has changed opinions about City’s title chances. Watford have drawn three this season and given how City eased past Chelsea at the Etihad Stadium, Quique Flores’s men may be grateful if they can avoid a rout. Jamie Jackson"
1000,Chelsea,Crystal Palace,Fri 28 Aug 2015 15.00 BST,2015-16,"Chelsea have not lost to Palace at Stamford Bridge since 1982 and will consider this a opportunity to kickstart their season after a sloppy start. John Terry’s absence is a blow, though José Mourinho will be acutely aware of the threat the visitors pose on the flanks. Alan Pardew might rue the absence of the underused Mile Jedinak with a hamstring injury though Connor Wickham’s availability after a rib injury is a boost. Dominic Fifield"
1001,Bournemouth,Leicester City,Fri 28 Aug 2015 14.03 BST,2015-16,"Eddie Howe will be feeling good after securing Bournemouth’s first Premier League victory at West Ham last Saturday. But the Leicester manager, Claudio Ranieri, is also flying high as his side remain unbeaten. Two form players will come head to head, with Callum Wilson looking to build on his hat-trick at Upton Park while the Leicester winger, Riyad Mahrez, has scored six goals in his last six league games. Ben Fisher"
1002,Liverpool,West Ham United,Fri 28 Aug 2015 13.08 BST,2015-16,"Slaven Bilic must hope West Ham perform better on their travels after the optimism of an opening day win at Arsenal was punctured by home defeats to Leicester City and Bournemouth. For perspective, however, it is worth noting his club’s last win at Anfield came courtesy of goals from Geoff Hurst and Martin Peters in September 1963. Liverpool will equal their best start to a Premier League season after four matches with a win and are aiming to keep four clean sheets in a row for the first time since 2011. Andy Hunter"
1003,Club Brugge,Manchester United,Tue 25 Aug 2015 18.55 BST,2015-16,"Manchester United are expected to make two changes to the side that won 3-1 in last week’s first leg with Bastian Schweinsteiger replacing Michael Carrick in central midfield and Marouane Fellaini coming in for Adnan Januzaj in the No10 role. Club Brugge are still hampered by an extensive injury list, made worse by Brandon Mechele’s suspension after his sending off at Old Trafford. Rich Flower"
1004,Crystal Palace,Aston Villa,Fri 21 Aug 2015 17.13 BST,2015-16,"Three points apiece after two games is a solid return for both sides but as they face Chelsea, Manchester City and Tottenham next, Palace’s need is greater. There was no shame in the narrow defeat to Arsenal last week but last season’s record of 10 defeats at Selhurst Park was poor. By contrast, Villa won at Bournemouth on the opening day and will be confident they can repeat last season’s victory on Saturday afternoon. Ed Aarons"
1005,Manchester United,Newcastle United,Fri 21 Aug 2015 17.01 BST,2015-16,"Louis van Gaal will be confident United will continue to improve on their solid start to the season. With Wayne Rooney misfiring, the manager will more than likely lean on the fast-flourishing attacking threat of Memphis Depay to break down Newcastle. Steve McClaren will be conscious that Newcastle’s defending has to improve, after Jefferson Montero tore them apart last Saturday, if they are to secure a positive result from the encounter. Graham Searles"
1006,Watford,Southampton,Fri 21 Aug 2015 16.34 BST,2015-16,"Quique Flores has not wanted to talk about his previous with Ronald Koeman, namely about when he was sacked by Valencia in 2007 and, four days later, the Dutchman was the Spanish club’s new manager. It felt, at the time, as though Koeman had been lined up before Flores’s dismissal. Flores has eyes only for beating Koeman’s Southampton and building on Watford’s solid start. Koeman needs a response after last Saturday’s humbling against Everton. David Hytner"
1007,West Bromwich Albion,Chelsea,Fri 21 Aug 2015 16.16 BST,2015-16,"Visits to The Hawthorns have had dire ramifications for recent Chelsea managers. André Villas Boas and Roberto di Matteo were ousted soon after defeats in the Black Country and, while the same fate will not await José Mourinho, this is still an awkward trip at a tricky time. The champions are enduring their worst start since 1998 and, having toasted the arrivals of Baba Rahman and Pedro Rodríguez, are anxious for a first win this term. Tony Pulis has beaten Mourinho with Crystal Palace and West Brom in the last 16 months. His own side’s slow start to the season could also do with a fillip. Dominic Fifield"
1008,Sunderland,Swansea City,Fri 21 Aug 2015 15.59 BST,2015-16,"Alan Shearer has predicted that, with Jefferson Montero running riot for Swansea, Sunderland could well lose by a cricket score. After conceding seven goals in their opening two games, even the Wearside club’s new shirt sponsors, the bookmaker Dafabet, are tipping them for relegation. Dick Advocaat aims to change the narrative but may find Montero, Bafetimbi Gomis and friends unforgiving opponents. His predecessor Gus Poyet wanted to model Sunderland on Swansea but that now seems a distant dream. Louise Taylor"
1009,Everton,Manchester City,Fri 21 Aug 2015 15.24 BST,2015-16,"Roberto Martínez was effusive in his praise of Manuel Pellegrini’s team on Friday. “City look sharper than ever,” he said. “They look like title challengers after only two games and that is an incredible statement.” It is also a fair statement to make after City opened with two 3-0 wins, the second a comprehensive defeat of Chelsea, but Everton took many by surprise with the manner of their own 3-0 win at Southampton last weekend and will pose a stern test to City should they recreate that fine team performance. Andy Hunter"
1010,Leicester City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 21 Aug 2015 15.05 BST,2015-16,This week’s capture of the Swiss international Gokhan Inler for £5m added to the happy vibes that Leicester City have been emitting since their dashing start to the season under Claudio Ranieri. It will be interesting to whether Inler’s arrival will lead to the manager tinkering with a line-up that has recorded wins in their first two matches. Tottenham need to improve the support to Harry Kane and wring more resilience from a defence that folded late against Stoke last week if they are to stop Leicester making it three wins in a row. Paul Doyle
1011,Arsenal,Liverpool,Fri 21 Aug 2015 14.50 BST,2015-16,"This will be a better test of Liverpool’s recovery this season after the traumas of the last campaign. They arrive at the Emirates with a pristine record to date, but with only one win at Arsenal in 15 years and with the hosts intent upon making amends for their opening weekend home defeat to West Ham. Arsène Wenger’s side looked more like their spritely selves at Selhurst Park last Sunday and pose far more of a threat with the forward propulsion of Alexis Sánchez in their ranks. Liverpool cannot permit the Chilean the same space to revel afforded him by Palace. Dominic Fifield"
1012,Norwich City,Stoke City,Fri 21 Aug 2015 14.29 BST,2015-16,"Norwich may be struggling to bring in reinforcements with the transfer deadline looming but Alex Neil struck on a winning formula at Sunderland last week, Nathan Redmond and Cameron Jerome adding thrust from the start. Neil would like a new striker but, for now at least, Gary Hooper and Ricky van Wolfswinkel remain options. Xherdan Shaqiri stands to make his debut for Stoke, whose comeback at White Hart Lane last Saturday suggests the Canaries will have to work hard for the kind of home win that might keep them up. Nick Ames"
1013,West Ham United,Bournemouth,Fri 21 Aug 2015 12.36 BST,2015-16,Bournemouth performed well against Liverpool but all they had to show for their spirited effort at Anfield was a tale of misfortune after a night that was defined by two poor refereeing decisions. Eddie Howe’s side are goalless and pointless after their first two matches. Will it be third time lucky against West Ham? Slaven Bilic’s side are reeling from their defeat to Leicester City last Saturday and Upton Park will a nervy place if the Cherries pick up their first Premier League win. Jacob Steinberg

Phil Jones remains out with thrombosis and Jonny Evans is a doubt after missing training on Tuesday but Louis van Gaal will be grateful that he has so few problems to deal with compared to his counterpart, Michel Preud’homme – the away side could be missing eight or nine players due to injury.

1015,Southampton,Everton,Fri 14 Aug 2015 18.11 BST,2015-16,Kevin Mirallas is expected to recover from a knock picked up against Watford but Everton will be without Leighton Baines who will miss 12-14 weeks following ankle surgery. Ronald Koeman is missing Jordy Clasie after the midfielder injured his ankle playing for the Under-21s while the defender Steven Caulker has a sinus infection. Jay Rodriguez should be available though after playing 65 minutes at Newcastle last Sunday. Sam Robinson
1016,Sunderland,Norwich City,Fri 14 Aug 2015 17.52 BST,2015-16,"After Sunderland’s 4-2 defeat at Leicester last weekend the Stadium of Light is likely to be extremely nervous. Dick Advocaat aims to adjust the mood by offering Yann M’Vila a debut alongside Lee Cattermole in central midfield. On loan from Rubin Kazan, M’Vila has already made quite an impact, having been sent off for head-butting an opponent in an appearance for Sunderland’s Under-21s. With his consequent suspension not affecting first team games, he may well be tasked with cramping Nathan Redmond’s style.Louise Taylor"
1017,Watford,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 14 Aug 2015 17.39 BST,2015-16,"If Watford have changed hugely since the Pozzo takeover, it’s probably just as well: in 11 matches against the old-style club, as manager of Gillingham, Bristol City, Plymouth and Stoke, Tony Pulis lost only once, with five wins and five draws. West Brom will want to atone for a feeble performance against Manchester City. Both clubs’ record signings, Steven Berghuis and Salomon Rondón, could debut from the bench. Simon Burnton"
1018,Swansea City,Newcastle United,Fri 14 Aug 2015 17.23 BST,2015-16,"Swansea and Newcastle will be looking to build on 2-2 draws in their opening matches. Garry Monk confirmed that Ki Sung-yueng returned to training yesterday after limping off with a hamstring injury against Chelsea, but a decision on his fitness will be left to the last minute. Newcastle are without Paul Dummett and Rémy Cabella but £13m striker Aleksandar Mitrovic is in contention to start after coming off the bench last weekend, though the man he may replace, Papiss Cissé, has four goals in his previous three visits to South Wales. Sam Robinson"
1019,Liverpool,Bournemouth,Fri 14 Aug 2015 16.42 BST,2015-16,"Bournemouth’s first away game as a Premier League club takes them to Anfield where Eddie Howe will be looking for his newly-promoted side to rectify the profligacy that contributed to their opening defeat by Aston Villa. Liverpool created fewer chances in their first game at Stoke City but took the three points that matter and, for all the pressure on Brendan Rodgers going into the campaign, his club have an ideal chance to start with two wins for only the fifth time in the Premier League era. Andy Hunter"

Whether the latter will materially affect the club is to be discovered, and following City’s fine 3-0 win at West Brom, which Albion Manuel Pellegrini’s side are favourites. However, it still would not surprise if Mourinho leaves the Etihad Stadium with three points. Jamie Jackson"
1021,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Fri 14 Aug 2015 15.36 BST,2015-16,"Arsenal are in familiar territory. After the shock defeat to West Ham, which actually did not feel that shocking, they must, to borrow the well-worn Arsène Wenger line, show that they have the quality to respond. “It’s how you respond that makes your season,” Wenger said, for the 187th time. Alexis Sánchez is champing at the bit to be unleashed from the start but it will not be easy at Palace, where morale is high. David Hytner"
1022,Tottenham Hotspur,Stoke City,Fri 14 Aug 2015 14.36 BST,2015-16,"Both of these teams lost their opening-day games so it will be intriguing to see how they approach this match – will fear of another defeat take over or will a determination to get off to winning ways see an outbreak of attacking play? Either way, Stoke’s £12m signing Xherdan Shaqiri will not be involved due to a suspension carried over from his time playing for Internazionale. Sachin Nakrani"
1023,West Ham United,Leicester City,Fri 14 Aug 2015 13.59 BST,2015-16,"Slaven Bilic’s West Ham stunned Arsenal at the Emirates Stadium but he has warned they will have to perform at the same level against Leicester, who thrashed Sunderland at the King Power Stadium. Reece Oxford should start in midfield again for West Ham after his starring role against Arsenal, while Jamie Vardy is expected to play for Leicester after the club disciplined him for making a racial slur at a fellow gambler in a casino.

1024,Aston Villa,Manchester United,Thu 13 Aug 2015 20.57 BST,2015-16,"Louis van Gaal’s goalkeeping troubles continue, with neither David de Gea or Víctor Valdés available for Manchester United. But Sergio Romero, with 62 caps for Argentina to his name and a clean sheet on debut, is not a bad third-choice option to have. Aston Villa’s new signing José Ángel Crespo is still out with a knee problem but Libor Kozak may feature for the first time since January 2014 after recovering from a nasty leg break. Rich Flower"
1028,Newcastle United,Southampton,Fri 7 Aug 2015 18.04 BST,2015-16,"Erwin Koeman, Southampton’s assistant manager, is expected to be in charge of the away side while his brother Ronald recovers from an operation to repair a ruptured achilles tendon. There is also a change of personnel in the home dug-out where Steve McClaren makes his first competitive appearance as Newcastle United’s manager. It is the former England coach’s first return to the Premier League since leaving Middlesbrough nine years ago and Tynesiders will be keen to assess his philosophy and tactics while also taking a first look at Newcastle’s three summer signings, Georginio Wijnaldum, Alexsandar Mitrovic and Chancel Mbemba. Louise Taylor"
1029,Chelsea,Swansea City,Fri 7 Aug 2015 17.37 BST,2015-16,"Defeats in their final two pre-season matches plus doubts over Diego Costa’s perennial hamstring problems have given José Mourinho a major headache before the first match of their title defence. Having won at Old Trafford on opening day last year, a Swansea side bolstered by the arrival of Ghana forward André Ayew will provide a real test of Chelsea’s readiness for the new campaign. Ed Aarons"
1030,Leicester City,Sunderland,Fri 7 Aug 2015 17.25 BST,2015-16,"It was against Sunderland last May that Leicester secured their Premier League status and the aim is to beat the same opponents at the start of an uncertain campaign. Nigel Pearson has gone, Claudio Ranieri has arrived, and few believe that change is for the better. The visitors kept their manager over the summer and brought in some interesting additions, most notably Yann M’Vila. Sachin Nakrani"
1031,Norwich City,Crystal Palace,Fri 7 Aug 2015 17.14 BST,2015-16,"Norwich return to the top flight in reasonable fettle although Youssouf Mulumbu, the midfielder signed from West Brom, misses out with a broken metatarsal. Another new signing, Robbie Brady from Hull, is likely to fill in for the injured Martin Olsson at left-back. Glenn Murray should start for Crystal Palace despite Bournemouth’s interest, and Yohan Cabaye will make his debut. Nick Ames"
1032,Manchester United,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 7 Aug 2015 17.04 BST,2015-16,"Louis van Gaal does not wish to suffer a repeat of last season’s opening day defeat to Swansea City at Old Trafford yet he enters this match with unwanted headaches. David de Gea will not play because he is distracted by Real Madrid’s interest and to replace his No1 the manager has only the untested Sam Johnstone or Sergio Romero. Bastian Schweinsteiger, his headline central midfield summer signing, is not match-fit and, if Wayne Rooney was to suffer injury, Van Gaal has only Javier Hernández or James Wilson to replace his central striker. Given the £230m investment the manager has overseen in his 12 months in charge United should still defeat Tottenham. Jamie Jackson"
1033,Arsenal,West Ham United,Fri 7 Aug 2015 16.55 BST,2015-16,"Things have not started well for Slaven Bilic and, after his Europa League shadow team selection gamble backfired and West Ham were knocked out of the competition by Astra Giurgiu, their supporters are already grumbling. Perhaps, in time, Bilic will be glad to be free of a draining European campaign but right now he needs a tonic and Arsenal, who are flying high after their Community Shield victory, looks like a daunting assignment. David Hytner"
1034,Bournemouth,Aston Villa,Fri 7 Aug 2015 14.17 BST,2015-16,"The moment has arrived and Bournemouth can hardly wait to get going. Their first ever season in the top flight begins with a home game against Aston Villa, the Vitality Stadium should be rocking and Eddie Howe’s side will be determined to prove that winning the Championship was no fluke. As for Villa, there is an air of uncertainty around Tim Sherwood’s side after the sale of Fabian Delph and Christian Benteke. Jacob Steinberg"
1035,Stoke City,Liverpool,Fri 7 Aug 2015 13.55 BST,2015-16,"Perhaps 77 days is not enough time to heal the scars of a club’s heaviest defeat for 52 years but Liverpool return to the Britannia Stadium needing immediate evidence of progress after another summer of big investment. Both teams have undergone substantial change since Stoke humiliated Brendan Rodgers’ men 6-1 on the final day of last season with Mark Hughes making eight signings this summer, including the former Liverpool right-back Glen Johnson, compared to Liverpool’s seven. Ryan Shawcross’ injury and Steven N’Zonzi’s exit could impact on Stoke’s strength down their spine. Andy Hunter"
1036,Arsenal,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 22 May 2015 18.11 BST,2014-15,"Arsène Wenger has spoken of a season of progress and while Arsenal supporters are grateful not to be sweating on a top-four place on the final day, they are also rather miffed at three successive home games without scoring that do not bode too well for next Saturday’s FA Cup final. Tony Pulis’s Albion, safe and having just mauled the champions 3-0, will be out to make that four. Paul Chronnell"
1037,Leicester City,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 22 May 2015 17.59 BST,2014-15,"After guiding Leicester City to safety, Nigel Pearson will want to end the season with a seventh home win and a 14th-place finish after being bottom of the Premier League just six weeks ago. For Chris Ramsey it is a chance for Queens Park Rangers to bow out of the top flight with pride and they could even claw their way up to 19th if they manage to better Burnley’s result at Aston Villa. Harry Edwards"
1038,Crystal Palace,Swansea City,Fri 22 May 2015 17.40 BST,2014-15,"Swansea find themselves in the odd position of having literally nothing to play for on the last day of the season – they cannot catch Southampton above them and cannot be overtaken by Stoke, who trail them by five points. Palace could still sneak into the top 10 if they win and other results go their way which would be quite an achievement given their situation when Alan Pardew arrived in January. Rich Flower"
1039,Aston Villa,Burnley,Fri 22 May 2015 17.26 BST,2014-15,"Tim Sherwood could be forgiven for having an eye, or possibly even both eyes, on next week’s FA Cup final against Arsenal. But even though Aston Villa’s top-flight place is safe and already-relegated Burnley are heading to Villa Park, he has vowed not to rest players. The visitors, with little but pride to play for, could still suffer the ignominy of finishing bottom if Queens Park Rangers can avoid defeat at Leicester. Rich Flower"

This time they have to win and hope Newcastle don’t defeat West Ham. United have secured a Champions League place so will be a touch relaxed no matter how professional they attempt to be. This could give Hull the chance to pull off the required victory – then it is all about what occurs on Tyneside. Jamie Jackson
1041,Chelsea,Sunderland,Fri 22 May 2015 17.01 BST,2014-15,"These sides have met their season’s objectives, which should transform Stamford Bridge into something of a celebration. Dick Advocaat’s achievement in retaining Sunderland’s top flight status should be lauded. José Mourinho, the manager of the season, would have preferred to have hoisted the silverware after the victory over Crystal Palace earlier this month but will still savour the moment as he flings more youngsters into the fray to gain experience. He pinpointed the 5-3 defeat at Tottenham on New Year’s Day as psychologically important for his team. They have not looked back since. Dominic Fifield"

For Roberto Martínez, the aim is to hold on to a place in the top half after a difficult season and, possibly, give Sylvain Distin a more fitting end to a fine Everton career having frozen the veteran defender out of his plans since January. Aaron Lennon is ineligible to face his parent club. Andy Hunter"
1045,Manchester City,Southampton,Fri 22 May 2015 15.02 BST,2014-15,"A season that started so brightly for Southampton has faded somewhat as the climax approaches but, after the ructions of last summer, most supporters would have gladly accepted seventh place if offered it at the start of the campaign.

Not exactly roasting but warm enough to discard winter scarves – well unless you are Dick Advocaat. Sunderland’s manager has wrapped his neck in a piece of “lucky” brown wool – “stylish eh,” he says – ever since succeeding Gus Poyet and, after wearing it during last week’s rather flukey win at Everton, is unlikely to dispense with it. A game Advocaat could do with winning slightly more than Nigel Pearson.

United, who have lost Michael Carrick for the rest of the season, will hope for better. The recent wobble has left their Champions League place under threat from Liverpool and it will not be straightforward against Palace, who beat Manchester City at Selhurst Park last month.

Yet even the very highest-calibre coaches rarely relish visits from Tony Pulis. West Bromwich Albion would certainly enjoy compounding Newcastle’s relegation troubles by consigning them to a ninth straight defeat.

With Manchester City having won three on the bounce there should only be one result.

However, it will still be tough as there is a fierce determination in the Everton squad to finish a disappointing season strongly. Graham Searles"
1066,Hull City,Arsenal,Fri 1 May 2015 18.53 BST,2014-15,"Steve Bruce may be tempted to look back on October’s meeting at the Emirates when his Hull side led 2-1 before Danny Welbeck’s injury-time equaliser. An extra two points would be very welcome now but Tuesday’s win against Liverpool has renewed the optimism on Humberside. Arsenal need one more win to all but seal a top-four place, though have designs on finishing second. Paul Chronnell"
1067,Sunderland,Southampton,Fri 1 May 2015 18.06 BST,2014-15,"Incentives and subplots abound. While Sunderland are desperate to avenge an 8-0 humiliation at Southampton earlier in the season and Dick Advocaat is determined to keep them in the Premier League, Ronald Koeman remains on a mission to transport Southampton into Europe. Something has to give in this double-Dutch tactical duel but it will be no surprise if years of haphazard recruitment and general decision making continue to take their toll on a north east club who could do with emulating Southampton’s slick, intelligent synchronicity and efficiency behind the scenes. Louise Taylor"
1068,Tottenham Hotspur,Manchester City,Fri 1 May 2015 17.33 BST,2014-15,This one has an end-of-season feel to it. City will not win the title but they will finish in the top four while Tottenham will surely not finish in the top four and nor are they are relishing the chase for Europa League qualification. The worry for Manuel Pellegrini is that there is also an end-of-era feel to it. The manager’s job prospects at City are uncertain while his ageing squad looks set for a summer reboot. David Hytner
1069,Manchester United,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 1 May 2015 17.02 BST,2014-15,Sunday’s defeat to Everton consigned Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United to consecutive reverses for the first time in his inaugural season but Liverpool losing to Hull City then eased Champions League qualification concerns. The Dutchman put the 3-0 humiliation at Goodison Park down as a one-off. Expect Van Gaal to be a little less sanguine should struggling West Brom turn United over and make it a twice-off. Jamie Jackson
1070,Swansea City,Stoke City,Fri 1 May 2015 16.12 BST,2014-15,"These two teams are locked in mid-table with no Europa League aspirations but securing eighth place would guarantee either of them a highest ever Premier League finish. Garry Monk described the game as probably Swansea’s most important of the season, but Stoke will rely on their top scorer Mame Biram Diouf or perhaps on another strike from the in-form Charlie Adam, who will play with a protective mask after breaking his nose in training. Peter Georgiev "
1071,Aston Villa,Everton,Fri 1 May 2015 15.18 BST,2014-15,"With thoughts of the FA Cup final shelved this is one of three home games Tim Sherwood is targeting as Villa, two points above trouble, play for survival.

Everton are unbeaten in six games, last lost to Villa in August 2010 and not yet on the beach. Mark Tallentire"
1072,Chelsea,Crystal Palace,Fri 1 May 2015 15.04 BST,2014-15,"Stamford Bridge will thrill in anticipation of Chelsea’s first Premier League title in five years. The hosts will secure the crown with victory and, given their unbeaten home record this season and Crystal Palace’s recent slip in standards with safety assured, the opportunity is there for the taking. “Them winning the league would be deserved because they’ve done extraordinarily well this season,” said Yannick Bolasie, “but we don’t want them to do it against us.” That may be wishful thinking given it is 33 years since Palace last won at Chelsea. Dominic Fifield"
1073,Liverpool,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 1 May 2015 14.33 BST,2014-15,"QPR have only four games to overturn a four-point deficit and preserve their Premier League status with the first of three remaining away matches coming at a ground where they have won once in their history. The statistics do not augur well for Chris Ramsey’s team but they can take hope from the hangover Liverpool have been nursingsince their FA Cup semi-final defeat. Champions League qualification is fading from view for Brendan Rodgers’ men. Steven Gerrard, having been rested for the midweek defeat at Hull City, is available to make his penultimate Anfield appearance. Andy Hunter"
1074,West Ham United,Burnley,Fri 1 May 2015 13.24 BST,2014-15,"Sean Dyche must have hoped that his side’s victory over Manchester City in March would kickstart a survival bid but Burnley have not scored and picked up only one point from the five matches since then, and last Saturday’s home defeat by Leicester means they head to east London five points adrift of safety. West Ham, with only one win in their last 13 games, seem ideal opposition. Paul Chronnell"
1075,Leicester City,Newcastle United,Fri 1 May 2015 12.29 BST,2014-15,"It remains to be seen whether the realisation that Newcastle have fallen into the relegation fight will jolt John Carver’s side into action – if it does not, then chances are that Leicester will drag them further into trouble on Saturday lunchtime by earning the victory that would take them to within a point of Newcastle, who were 17 points clear of Nigel Pearson’s side before this seven-match losing streak. Leicester played well when losing to Chelsea in midweek and will be confident of recording a fifth win in six matches. Paul Doyle"
1076,Manchester City,Aston Villa,Fri 24 Apr 2015 18.16 BST,2014-15,"Manchester City have won six of the last seven league encounters against Aston Villa. It might not be a procession this time, though, with Tim Sherwood’s FA Cup finalists showing strength to turn around their Wembley tie against Liverpool last weekend. Without Belgium team-mate Vincent Kompany in his way, Christian Benteke could extend his scoring run to five games in a row. Graham Searles"

A year on from David Moyes’ final game at United, against his former club of all teams, Louis van Gaal takes his in-form side to Everton seeking to strengthen claims on automatic Champions League qualification. United need a response to last weekend’s defeat at Chelsea with Man City and Liverpool in pursuit but Roberto Martínez’s side have improved of a difficult season with four wins in a five-game unbeaten run.

1081,Southampton,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 24 Apr 2015 14.54 BST,2014-15,"Mauricio Pochettino does not hide the fact that he would rather be spared the toils of the Europa League next season, yet he will surely want Tottenham to win on his return to St Mary’s. Ronald Koeman, by contrast, is eager for his team to qualify for European competition and victory over Spurs would help secure that and also give the club more points than they achieved under the Argentinian last term. Paul Doyle"
1082,Arsenal,Chelsea,Fri 24 Apr 2015 14.42 BST,2014-15,"Arsenal have their opportunity to nibble at Chelsea’s lead, with Arsène Wenger seeking a first victory over a José Mourinho side at the 13th try, and to postpone the visitors’ coronation for another week at least. The focus will be drawn towards Cesc Fàbregas on his first return to the Emirates as a Chelsea player with Mourinho’s sales pitch having lured him from Barcelona last summer. “I promised him he’d be an important player in our project,” said the Portuguese. “And that, normally, good projects end with titles.” The home support will be pained that their former favourite is close to achieving that aim. Dominic Fifield"
1083,Burnley,Leicester City,Fri 24 Apr 2015 13.49 BST,2014-15,"Three successive victories have lifted Leicester City off the foot of the table and they will look to continue that run against Burnley, the side who now find themselves propping up the rest of the league. It promises to be a tumultuous affair at Turf Moor. Leicester are in form, while Burnley will fight until the end. However Burnley have problems in attack, with Ashley Barnes suspended and Danny Ings goalless in his past eight matches. Jacob Steinberg"
1084,Newcastle United,Swansea City,Fri 24 Apr 2015 13.01 BST,2014-15,After six straight defeats and with relegation fears not quite banished John Carver could do with Newcastle finally winning a game. Supporters plan to stand up en masse in the 34th minute to protest against Mike Ashley’s ownership where cash reserves of £34m sit untouched in the bank while a threadbare squad remains alarmingly under-staffed. Carver has said Newcastle may need to play ugly and there promises to be a contrast between their tactics and Swansea’s possession game. Louise Taylor
1085,Queens Park Rangers,West Ham United,Fri 24 Apr 2015 12.31 BST,2014-15,"If QPR are to accumulate sufficient points to stay up, Chris Ramsey will have marked this game as a must-win. The manager will be plotting trips to Anfield and the Etihad after this as matches they would not be expected to triumph in. West Ham, currently 10th and with one win from 12 in all competitions, are easing to the finish line and look to be there for the taking. Alan Smith"
1086,Chelsea,Manchester United,Fri 17 Apr 2015 18.07 BST,2014-15,"Louis van Gaal’s side will arrive in south-west London in the best form of their campaign but with their defensive ranks severely depleted by injury and suspension. Phil Jones, Michael Carrick, Daley Blind, Marcos Rojo and Jonny Evans will all be absent, but there will be no sympathy from José Mourinho. “Their squad is amazing, in numbers, players, experience, solutions,” said the Portuguese, whose side can move 11 points clear of their visitors with victory. Chelsea, who will give a late check to Loïc Rémy, know a win will bring the title tantalisingly within reach. Dominic Fifield"
1087,Everton,Burnley,Fri 17 Apr 2015 17.49 BST,2014-15,"Everton will hope that the return of Romelu Lukaku will give them impetus to equal their season’s best run, five games unbeaten, as a disappointing campaign draws to a close. Burnley, glad to see the back of eight matches against the league’s top eight, will be fighting hard to pick up three points in their fight to stay up at Goodison, which is not the fortress that it was last season. This is the 100th top-flight meeting between the two sides. Graham Searles"
1088,Newcastle United,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 17 Apr 2015 17.13 BST,2014-15,"Newcastle have lost five consecutive Premier League games and it looks as if some players have already begun to think of pastures new. John Carver will find it tough motivating his side considering their abject form and Tottenham Hotspur will be looking to capitalise on this. Spurs may also struggle for motivation, though, as it looks as if they will miss out on the Champions League. Graham Searles"
1089,Crystal Palace,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 17 Apr 2015 16.35 BST,2014-15,"This time last year Tony Pulis was being feted for his remarkable rescue act at Selhurst Park, a mantle that has now passed on to Alan Pardew who, with eight wins from 12 games, has banished thoughts of relegation. Pulis initially performed a similar feat at The Hawthorns too, but returns to Palace after successive home defeats to QPR and Leicester that mean Albion are not safe yet. Paul Chronnell"
1090,Leicester City,Swansea City,Fri 17 Apr 2015 16.10 BST,2014-15,"Suddenly Leicester is awash with optimism. Bottom of the table since November, the Foxes could leap out of the relegation zone with victory over a depleted Swansea side. While Garry Monk has to decide who to turn to for goals in the absence of striker Bafétimbi Gomis, Nigel Pearson has a fully fit squad and players who are infused with confidence following two successive victories. Erratic finishing has been a recurring problem for Leicester this season, but if they are wearing their shooting boots on Saturday, the hosts could claim a precious three points. Paul Doyle"
1091,Aston Villa,Liverpool,Fri 17 Apr 2015 15.45 BST,2014-15,"Villa beat Liverpool at Anfield in September and will feel liberated by last week’s win at Tottenham Hotspur, where Christian Benteke’s eighth goal in six games took Tim Sherwood’s team six points clear of the relegation zone. Liverpool, however, who stand 25 points above their opponents in the Premier League table, are edging back into form and have won the last six of seven FA Cup ties between these clubs. Villa’s success came in the semi-final of 1897. Daniel Sturridge’s fitness and Steven Gerrard’s availability pose selection dilemmas for Brendan Rodgers. Andy Hunter"
1092,Manchester City,West Ham United,Fri 17 Apr 2015 15.17 BST,2014-15,"The fascination with this fixture lies in what may happen to Manuel Pellegrini if Manchester City lose. If the champions were to suffer a seventh defeat in nine outings to continue their slump in 2015 – City were joint-top on New Year’s Day and are now fourth – the manager’s position may become untenable. In this scenario Liverpool, who are in FA Cup semi-final action this weekend, could close to only a point behind if they won their extra match. A victory, though, and Pellegrini’s garden, and that of City’s, becomes far rosier. Jamie Jackson"
1093,Reading,Arsenal,Fri 17 Apr 2015 14.00 BST,2014-15,"Arsenal continue their defence of the FA Cup against Reading, who have never beaten the Gunners in 12 attempts. Arsène Wenger will want to make sure his players do not reproduce last year’s nervous semi-final performance. On current form they should make light work of Reading, but Steve Clarke will hope there is still one more giant-killing left in this year’s competition. Graham Searles"
1094,Stoke City,Southampton,Fri 17 Apr 2015 12.56 BST,2014-15,Southampton travel to Stoke hoping to keep their Champions League ambitions alive. The Saints are five points behind fourth-placed Man City and will believe that overhauling the champions is still possible. Mark Hughes has said he will use the game to gauge Stoke’s progress and any positive result would show they had made some as Stoke have lost to Southampton twice this season. Graham Searles
1095,West Ham United,Stoke City,Fri 10 Apr 2015 18.37 BST,2014-15,"Although unhelpful, fresh doubts over the long-term future of the West Ham manager, Sam Allardyce, should not derail West Ham’s hopes of securing a top-half finish. The hosts have lost four of their past five matches and go into the game level on points with Stoke, who have lost their previous three. This hardly suggests a classic is in store but keep an eye on Peter Crouch, who is one headed goal away from Alan Shearer’s Premier League record of 46. Ben Fisher"
1096,Manchester United,Manchester City,Fri 10 Apr 2015 18.19 BST,2014-15,Can Manchester United beat Manchester City for the first time on their own patch since 2011? Can Manuel Pellegrini’s champions halt a slide that has featured three defeats in the past five league games? The answers to these questions – and many more – should be known by 6pm on Sunday when whichever team has kept their head best amidst the sound and fury of the 169th derby has the best chance of claiming the spoils. Jamie Jackson
1097,Sunderland,Crystal Palace,Fri 10 Apr 2015 17.58 BST,2014-15,"Alan Pardew has a particular point to prove at a ground where he can expect plenty of abuse from the stands. As Newcastle United manager he lost his last four north-east derbies against Sunderland and will be anxious to see his Palace side wreak revenge on Dick Advocaat’s relegation-threatened team. Advocaat is likely to be wary of Palace’s counterattacking threat as he aims to build on last Sunday’s home triumph against John Carver’s Newcastle. Even if the current mini-heatwave continues, Sunderland’s Dutch manager is expected to wear his lucky brown winter scarf. Louise Taylor"
1098,Southampton,Hull City,Fri 10 Apr 2015 17.42 BST,2014-15,"Southampton’s challenge for a Champions League spot may have faded but Hull are unlikely to find them in an accommodating mood. A fifth-place finish is still very much within the home side’s grasp and that would represent a fine achievement for Ronald Koeman in his debut season. A lack of firepower has been the main reason for Southampton’s deteriorating results but their overall performances have remained impressive and they should be too strong for a creaking Hull side in danger of being sucked into the relegation zone. If Steve Bruce’s side are to save themselves, it will probably be during their remaining home fixtures. Paul Doyle"
1099,Liverpool,Newcastle United,Fri 10 Apr 2015 17.12 BST,2014-15,"Both managers require a response from their teams at Anfield but for very different reasons. Liverpool restored confidence by reaching the FA Cup semi-finals on Wednesday but, after consecutive defeats in the Premier League, can ill afford another slip if they are to catch any of the teams above them in the race for Champions League qualification. Newcastle should be safe on 35 points but, after the misery of another derby loss and amid growing supporter unrest, John Carver desperately needs to stem the decline. Andy Hunter"

Leicester, buoyed by a win over West Ham a week ago, need to keep building momentum if they are to defy the odds and survive an immediate return to the Championship. They sit six points from safety but have a favourable run-in. Alan Smith"

The visitors are in search of their eighth successive victory in all competitions, while Burnley have just one win from their past 10 games. Arsenal have not lost to a team in the bottom half this season but Sean Dyche’s side have already beaten one of the top four at Turf Moor, defeating the champions, Manchester City, 1-0 last month.

How he would love to get one over on his former club and show Tottenham Hotspur that they were wrong to sack him last summer, although it is not all about revenge for the Villa manager. His team are a mere three points above the bottom three and are winless in their past three matches. Yet putting an end to that worrying run will not be straightforward against Spurs, who have not completely given up hope of finishing in the top four. Jacob Steinberg"
1103,Queens Park Rangers,Chelsea,Fri 10 Apr 2015 15.01 BST,2014-15,"Queens Park Rangers should draw encouragement from four points and seven goals in two games on the road over the last week, though their more attacking approach might open the door for Chelsea to revel in the west London derby. José Mourinho has no qualms about selecting Nemanja Matic or Cesc Fàbregas, both of whom are one booking away from a two-match ban before the weekend cut-off. “We need points, we need victories, we cannot choose matches,” he said. The same applies to the hosts. Dominic Fifield"
1104,Swansea City,Everton,Fri 10 Apr 2015 13.35 BST,2014-15,"Swansea have never beaten Everton in the league though they saw them off 3-0 in the League Cup and another win would take the Swans past the previous-best points total of 47.

Mark Tallentire"
1105,West Bromwich Albion,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 3 Apr 2015 18.42 BST,2014-15,"Tony Pulis was typically assertive when he said on Friday that West Brom had “gone off the rails” in recent seasons and he is looking to rebuild the club from top to bottom. He has certainly improved West Brom but they could struggle if Saido Berahino and Brown Ideye fail late fitness tests. That said, QPR’s away form has been dreadful this season, so Pulis will surely remain confident. Graham Searles"
1106,Swansea City,Hull City,Fri 3 Apr 2015 18.12 BST,2014-15,"A home match against Hull offers Swansea a good chance to pick up their first points following an international break this season.

Yet as the final stretch of the “rat race” to qualify for the Champions League is entered Aston Villa arrive at Old Trafford having drawn 1-1 in the reverse fixture, despite having only 10 men for the final 25 minutes due to Gabriel Agbonlahor’s red card in that December game. This resilience means United may have a difficult time maintaining momentum though, really, given their £150m-plus summer transfer spend there should be only one victor. Jamie Jackson"
1108,Leicester City,West Ham United,Fri 3 Apr 2015 17.38 BST,2014-15,"Time is running out for Leicester City in the Premier League. Esteban Cambiasso said earlier in the week that staying up would be “like winning a trophy”.

Loïc Rémy’s winner at Hull City in their last fixture may end up as one of the campaign’s key goals. Stoke are safe and, despite having lost their last two games, will test the hosts’ resolve. “A difficult team,” said José Mourinho. An awkward, if not daunting, afternoon lies ahead for the leaders. Dominic Fifield"
1110,Burnley,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 3 Apr 2015 16.53 BST,2014-15,Burnley begin the day in the relegation zone but just one point from safety. Sean Dyche is unrelenting in his view that they can stay in the Premier League and his players will need to draw on every last drop of his defiance to keep Harry Kane from adding to his impressive goal tally.

As Dick Advocaat takes charge of Sunderland for the second time much looks set to hinge on the likely midfield duel involving the home enforcer Lee Cattermole and Moussa Sissoko. By uncanny coincidence, Advocaat’s two immediate predecessors, Gus Poyet and Paolo Di Canio, also faced Newcastle during their second matches at the helm, both securing slightly unexpected victories.

1112,Arsenal,Liverpool,Fri 3 Apr 2015 15.55 BST,2014-15,Arsenal can take a significant step towards qualifying for the Champions League and simultaneously dampen Liverpool’s hopes with a victory on Saturday. Arsène Wenger and Olivier Giroud’s manager and player of the month awards for March are testament to how strong the Gunners have been. Liverpool will miss the experience of Steven Gerrard and Martin Skrtel but Brendan Rodgers will know his side still have the quality to secure a vital win. Graham Searles
1113,Crystal Palace,Manchester City,Fri 3 Apr 2015 14.31 BST,2014-15,"The champions will be braced to start Monday’s game in south London nine points behind the leaders, Chelsea, and possibly even from a relatively lowly fourth place in the table, making victory at Selhurst Park essential. Their recent record at Crystal Palace is excellent, the hosts having failed to prevail in this fixture since December 2001, though Alan Pardew’s team have been resurgent of late.The visitors will enjoy the possession, but must be guarded for the pace on the counter offered by Jason Puncheon, Wilfried Zaha and Yannick Bolasie.

Ronald Koeman will hope the 38-year-old goalkeeper Kelvin Davis maintains the form that denied Burnley on his first league start for almost 15 months, with Fraser Forster out for the season, and his task will be helped if Romelu Lukaku fails a fitness test on a hamstring injury.

Aware of Papiss Cissé and Fabricio Coloccini’s suspensions, Arsène Wenger will sense an opportunity for Arsenal to mitigate their midweek Champions League disappointment against Monaco by continuing to conclude the League campaign in convincing style. Holland’s Daryl Janmaat, one of Carver’s two available senior defenders, will relocate from right-back to replace Coloccini at centre-half. Louise Taylor"

That result left Brendan Rodgers’ team 10th in the table and 10 points behind United but their recovery has been outstanding, with 33 points taken from the last 39 available.

1121,Stoke City,Crystal Palace,Fri 20 Mar 2015 16.07 GMT,2014-15,"Having dispatched QPR last Saturday, relegation fears are receding for Palace, but Alan Pardew will be keen for them not to get into flip-flops mode just yet. With a takeover of the club imminent, the Palace squad know an overhaul could be on the cards in the summer. Mark Hughes’s Stoke side sit in eighth, probably the summit of their ambitions, and look capable of staying there. Paul Chronnell"
1122,Manchester City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 20 Mar 2015 14.37 GMT,2014-15,"After the midweek travails in Catalonia that ended Manchester City’s Champions League dreams at the hands of Barcelona for a second successive year, West Brom’s visit allows Manuel Pellegrini’s beleaguered team to get back on track. That is the hope, of course. But with a record of three wins in their last 12 outings, City’s confidence is low and Albion are sure to make this an awkward early kick-off for the champions. Jamie Jackson"
1123,Southampton,Burnley,Fri 20 Mar 2015 13.18 GMT,2014-15,"Burnley’s survival battle looked doomed at the start of the month, but last Saturday’s defeat of the champions Manchester City has the Turf Moor faithful believing again, and Sunderland are looking vulnerable above them. Southampton are involved at the other end of the table, and their draw at Stamford Bridge showed why they have not yet given up on finishing in the top four. Paul Chronnell"
1124,Aston Villa,Swansea City,Fri 20 Mar 2015 12.22 GMT,2014-15,"After lifting the gloom at Villa Park and overseeing three straight wins, including that 4-0 thumping at Sunderland last Saturday, the challenge for Tim Sherwood now is to maintain momentum. With no change on the injury front, Sherwood’s only selection dilemma is whether Leandro Bacuna, who was excellent at Sunderland, should keep his place now that Alan Hutton is back from suspension. Garry Monk, Swansea’s manager, is expected to be able to call upon Federico Fernández, who missed the Liverpool defeat on Monday for personal reasons. Stuart James"
1125,Burnley,Manchester City,Fri 13 Mar 2015 18.41 GMT,2014-15,"These two sides met at the Etihad at the end of last year, and as Sean Dyche put it “a scratch of luck” helped Burnley claw back a 2-0 deficit to end the game 2-2. Dyche will have his fingers crossed for more of the same on Saturday, but the game will mean just as much to City who know they can’t afford to drop any more points if they have any chance at all of catching Chelsea for the title. Sean Morrison"
1126,Manchester United,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 13 Mar 2015 18.22 GMT,2014-15,"Now is the time for Louis van Gaal and his expensive squad of highly paid players to prove their worth to Manchester United as Tottenham Hotspur’s arrival for the late Sunday game starts the campaign’s crucial phase. United stand only three points ahead of Spurs in fourth place in the “rat race”, as Van Gaal continues to call it, for a Champions League berth. Next for United are Liverpool, at Anfield, before Manchester City and Chelsea are opponents in two of the following three matches. Jamie Jackson"
1127,Crystal Palace,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 13 Mar 2015 17.45 GMT,2014-15,"QPR have lost seven of their last eight league matches and yet they will go into this game with a degree of confidence, as they are somehow still within touching distance of safety and there has been a slight upswing in performances since Chris Ramsey replaced Harry Redknapp, even if results have not reflected that. If Rangers can abstain from ruining good general displays with sudden defensive mistakes, they might just get a positive result at Selhurst Park, where Palace remain a little vulnerable. Paul Doyle"
1128,Chelsea,Southampton,Fri 13 Mar 2015 17.34 GMT,2014-15,"José Mourinho has been at pains to draw a line under Chelsea’s midweek elimination from Europe, with his players apparently fit, focused and eager to return to domestic matters where a Premier League title must be claimed. Efforts will be made to liberate Diego Costa and revive Cesc Fàbregas after recent stodgy form, and Southampton will arrive braced for a backlash and have been suffering themselves of late – even their much-needed 1-0 win over Crystal Palace was not fluent. Both these teams are in need of a performance. Dominic Fifield"
1129,West Bromwich Albion,Stoke City,Fri 13 Mar 2015 17.21 GMT,2014-15,"After eight years as Stoke City’s manager, Tony Pulis entertains his former club knowing a win could take West Brom almost comfortably clear of the relegation zone. Mark Hughes, who has surprisingly presided over a higher win rate than Pulis since taking charge, will be looking to disturb the Baggies’ good form at home, where they have kept five clean sheets in their last six games in all competitions. Sean Morrison"
1130,Arsenal,West Ham United,Fri 13 Mar 2015 16.04 GMT,2014-15,"In a perfect world Arsène Wenger would be casting an eye towards Tuesday’s Champions League second leg in Monaco and tailoring his team accordingly, but so tight is the battle for top-four places, and so slender are Arsenal’s chances of progress to the quarter-finals after their first-leg disaster and 3-1 defeat, he has no margin for error against a West Ham side who have slipped to 10th but are still very capable, especially under the guidance of Sam Allardyce who will be keen to rediscover his old habit of getting under Wenger’s skin. Paul Chronnell"
1131,Leicester City,Hull City,Fri 13 Mar 2015 15.45 GMT,2014-15,"Leicester’s desperate scramble for a way out of the bottom three continues, and if ever there was a window of opportunity this could be it. Steve Bruce’s Hull have won only one of their last 13 away matches, and have won only one of their last seven league meetings with Leicester. Kasper Schmeichel is back for rock-bottom Leicester, after four months out, to face a team who have failed to score in seven of their last 10 away league games. Sean Morrison"
1132,Swansea City,Liverpool,Fri 13 Mar 2015 15.31 GMT,2014-15,"Liverpool will arrive in Wales looking to continue the form that has taken them back into top-four contention: unbeaten in the league in 2015 and buoyed by recent wins over Manchester City, Southampton and Spurs. Swansea lost the reverse fixture 4-1 but Garry Monk’s side will not be overawed – in their last home game they came from behind to beat Manchester United 2-1. Sean Morrison"
1133,Everton,Newcastle United,Fri 13 Mar 2015 14.36 GMT,2014-15,"Two Europa League meetings with Dynamo Kyiv followed by Newcastle United and then QPR in the Premier League could be a defining period in Everton’s season and the reign of Roberto Martínez. Tension was palpable inside Goodison Park against the Ukrainian league leaders, something John Carver’s side will look to capitalise on as they bid to improve a poor run of one win in eight Premier League away matches, but Everton held their nerve and rediscovered their verve to record a merited win. They must start in that vein on Sunday with the threat of relegation creeping. Andy Hunter"
1134,Sunderland,Aston Villa,Fri 13 Mar 2015 12.10 GMT,2014-15,"A big crowd, possibly in excess of 45,000, is expected as struggling Sunderland aim to end a run of five Premier League games without a win in this classic relegation “six-pointer”. Should Tim Sherwood choreograph a third straight victory for Aston Villa the mood on Wearside could well turn ugly. If Gus Poyet would be well advised to have a tin hat at hand on a day when he must cope without the suspended Lee Cattermole and Adam Johnson, Sherwood remains wary of Jermain Defoe’s potential penalty area menace. Louise Taylor"
1135,QPR,Tottenham,Fri 6 Mar 2015 17.14 GMT,2014-15,"Chris Ramsey will take pride from seeing so many of the players he coached as youngsters now performing well in Tottenham’s senior team but will also hope that Ryan Mason, Danny Rose, Andros Townsend and Harry Kane have off-days at Loftus Road. The apparent revival of Aston Villa under Ramsey’s former colleague Tim Sherwood increases the difficulty of the task facing Queens Park Rangers as they try to escape relegation. Much could depend on which of the top flight’s leading English scorers gets the better service: Ramsey has Charlie Austin but Spurs will be confident Kane will prevail. Paul Doyle"
1136,Chelsea,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 27 Feb 2015 18.25 GMT,2014-15,"Wembley will host a repeat of the 2007-08 final, when Juande Ramos’s Tottenham triumphed over Avram Grant’s Chelsea in extra time. Grant paid the price for defeat and was sacked the following May while Ramos made it to October before Daniel Levy moved him on. Neither manager looks vulnerable this time around but José Mourinho would love to seal a trophy after hopes of a quadruple were dashed by Bradford City last month. Rich Flower"
1137,Manchester United,Sunderland,Fri 27 Feb 2015 17.49 GMT,2014-15,"Robin van Persie’s ankle injury offers Radamel Falcao another chance to impress in attack after an underwhelming spell so far at Manchester United. He is likely to be partnered in attack by James Wilson, who has, arguably, outshone his more illustrious – and considerably higher paid – team-mate this season. Sunderland, with one win from their past 10 league games, need at least a point on Saturday to guarantee they will not be sucked into the bottom three. Rich Flower"
1138,Arsenal,Everton,Fri 27 Feb 2015 17.30 GMT,2014-15,Arsenal host Everton still smarting from Champions League humiliation against Monaco – but it is the visitors who seem more prone to a European hangover – despite convincing progress against Young Boys. Roberto Martínez’s side have won just twice from seven Premier League games after Thursday night Europa League action –and that was against relegation-threatened Burnley and QPR. Toby Moses
1139,Liverpool,Manchester City,Fri 27 Feb 2015 17.09 GMT,2014-15,"The Premier League’s in-form team host the reigning champions but both will be smarting from painful European experiences this week. Brendan Rodgers claimed City would have a “crucial” advantage owing to Liverpool’s Europa League trip to Besiktas, and that was before the tie went to extra time and his squad arrived back from Istanbul at 4.19am on Friday owing to a delayed flight. A comparatively refreshed City can exert more pressure on Capital One Cup finalists Chelsea by closing the gap to two points with a first win at Anfield since May 2003. Andy Hunter"
1140,Burnley,Swansea City,Fri 27 Feb 2015 15.54 GMT,2014-15,"Burnley have travelled more miles than any other top-flight side this season so will welcome the luxury of a home fixture. Swansea are 15 points away from the bottom three, 10 points short of the top four and went out of the FA Cup at Blackburn last week and thus would appear to have little to play for in their final 12 games. Sean Dyche’s side must make the most of games like this if they are to defy the odds and stay up. Rich Flower"
1141,Stoke City,Hull City,Fri 27 Feb 2015 15.22 GMT,2014-15,Hull have recovered well this month after a dreadful January in which they took only three points from a possible 12. Wins over Aston Villa and QPR and a draw at Manchester City have lifted Hull to 15th but Steve Bruce is under no illusions and has warned his players they remain in a “horrible dogfight”. Stoke welcome back Geoff Cameron after a ban but are still missing Ryan Shawcross. Rich Flower
1142,West Bromwich Albion,Southampton,Fri 27 Feb 2015 13.42 GMT,2014-15,"After losing 2-0 at home against Liverpool, Southampton will be happy to get back on the road, where recent results have been much better and helped to sustain their pursuit of a place in the top four. Ronald Koeman’s side have taken 13 points from a possible 15 away, although they will have to be at their best to continue that run against Albion, who are edging clear of the relegation zone and looking for a fifth clean sheet in seven league games under Tony Pulis. Stuart James"
1143,West Ham United,Crystal Palace,Fri 27 Feb 2015 12.58 GMT,2014-15,"West Ham have conceded last-minute equalisers against Manchester United and Tottenham and crashed out of the FA Cup during a frustrating run of five matches without a victory. Yet they will be confident of getting back to winning ways against Crystal Palace, who are five points above the bottom three. Alan Pardew’s side have injury worries in attack, Fraizer Campbell, Marouane Chamakh and Yaya Sanogo all unavailable. Jacob Steinberg"
1144,Newcastle United,Aston Villa,Fri 27 Feb 2015 12.28 GMT,2014-15,"Jonás Gutiérrez is expected to be back on Newcastle’s bench after recovering from testicular cancer with John Carver hoping his comeback lifts the mood in the wake of last weekend’s 5-0 thrashing at Manchester City. If Carver could do with a reassuring victory, Tim Sherwood will sense an opportunity to secure the first win of his Villa tenure. It should be intriguing to assess precisely how much more direct the new manager is making Paul Lambert’s old team. With both sides extremely swift on the break, this promises to be all about counter-attacking. Louise Taylor"
1145,Tottenham Hotspur,West Ham United,Fri 20 Feb 2015 18.03 GMT,2014-15,"Tottenham Hotspur have begun their Europa League knockout campaign and so will have the difficult task of managing Thursday night matches. This as an opportune moment for West Ham to head to White Hart Lane and if they are triumphant then European qualification hopes will be ignited. Most importantly for Spurs, Harry Kane returns after being rested in midweek. Graham Searles"
1146,Swansea City,Manchester United,Fri 20 Feb 2015 17.50 GMT,2014-15,"Swansea City’s best performance this season came in the reverse fixture on the opening day when Garry Monk’s side pulled off a dramatic 2-1 win at Old Trafford. Since then Swansea have been inconsistent and one fears for the Swans hosting United, with their current ability to get results without playing dazzling football. Louis van Gaal knows a win is important to keep the chasing pack looking for Champions League qualification at bay. Graham Searles"
1147,Sunderland,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 20 Feb 2015 17.28 GMT,2014-15,"Tony Pulis is probably the last person Gus Poyet wants to meet right now. Sunderland’s manager cannot be overly delighted at the prospect of clapping eyes on Brown Ideye, West Brom’s in-form £10m striker either as Pulis’s renascent side aim to exacerbate the Uruguayan’s recent misery. After writing an extraordinary open letter to Sunderland fans, begging for their backing, Poyet could do with his side registering what would be only their third home league win all season. Should they stumble, what happens next is anyone’s guess. Louise Taylor"
1148,Aston Villa,Stoke City,Fri 20 Feb 2015 17.11 GMT,2014-15,"Tim Sherwood officially takes charge of his first game as Aston Villa manager against Stoke City. He certainly talks a good game but turning around his side’s recent form will be a very tough task. However, there is no better time to face Stoke City at home as they have lost 4-1 in consecutive matches on the road. Mark Hughes will not want to witness a third away drubbing and will be looking to upset Sherwood on his debut. Graham Searles"
1149,Everton,Leicester City,Fri 20 Feb 2015 16.44 GMT,2014-15,"Nigel Pearson’s bottom-placed side arrive at Goodison Park on the back of four consecutive defeats and will hope a Thursday night game on an artificial pitch has taken a toll on Everton. Roberto Martínez’s side again showed they are more at home in the Europa League than domestically with the 4-1 win over Young Boys in Bern. Confidence should have improved as a result, although Everton have won only two of six matches following European exertions so far this season. Andy Hunter"
1150,Manchester City,Newcastle United,Fri 20 Feb 2015 16.12 GMT,2014-15,"Manchester City welcome Wilfried Bony to their ranks for the first time on match-day as the champions’ quest to maintain pressure on Chelsea continues when Newcastle United visit for the late kick-off. With José Mourinho’s side seven points ahead and only 13 matches remaining, City’s challenge is to go for a maximum return of 39 and hope Chelsea slip up. As it is seven years since the Magpies managed even a draw against City in the Premier League, Manuel Pellegrini should feel confident. Jamie Jackson"
1151,Chelsea,Burnley,Fri 20 Feb 2015 15.41 GMT,2014-15,"José Mourinho will be supremely confident Chelsea can sweep Burnley aside and continue their march towards the Premier League title. Diego Costa returns to the starting lineup after suspension, which will strike fear into Burnley hearts. Sean Dyche, however, will remind his players of Bradford’s unbelievable FA Cup upset at Stamford Bridge and will want them to reproduce that magic. Graham Searles"
1152,Hull City,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 20 Feb 2015 13.48 GMT,2014-15,"Hull City and QPR’s fortunes both improved last time out after much-needed victories and neither side find themselves in the relegation zone now. Chris Ramsey presided over QPR’s first away win of the season and he will be looking for a repeat performance to stay out of trouble. Steve Bruce, meanwhile, will want new signing Dame N’Doye to build on his promising debut. Graham Searles"
1153,Crystal Palace,Arsenal,Fri 20 Feb 2015 13.28 GMT,2014-15,Victory at Selhurst Park would lift Arsenal into the top four for at least 24 hours and also set them up nicely for their last-16 Champions League tie against Monaco on Wednesday. Arsène Wenger’s side have lost once since New Year’s Day and they are starting to build some momentum. Yet Crystal Palace are likely to be difficult opponents. They still need a few more points to ensure that they are not dragged into the relegation scrap. Jacob Steinberg
1154,Southampton,Liverpool,Fri 20 Feb 2015 12.49 GMT,2014-15,"This contest will provide another test of Southampton’s staying power, with Ronald Koeman’s side attempting to rekindle some of their trademark verve after one win in four matches in all competitions. They confront a Liverpool team who have found their own upbeat rhythm, with one loss in 17 and, in Adam Lallana, Rickie Lambert and Dejan Lovren, players who will relish returning to their former haunts. Only four points separate these sides at kick‑off. Each can deliver a statement of renewed intent with victory. Dominic Fifield"
1155,Aston Villa,Leicester City,Fri 13 Feb 2015 19.10 GMT,2014-15,"Aston Villa’s caretaker manager team of Andy and Scott Marshall will take charge of their first game since Paul Lambert’s departure. Their opponents, Leicester City, were thought to have sacked their manager, Nigel Pearson, last Sunday but the former Middlesbrough captain remains in charge. Defeat on Sunday seems unlikley to have much bearing on the situation, with top-flight survival a priority. Rich Flower"
1156,West Bromwich Albion,West Ham United,Fri 13 Feb 2015 18.56 GMT,2014-15,"Sam Allardyce’s pleasure getting the red card that was shown to Adrián in Wednesday’s 0-0 draw with Southamption overturned was tempered on Friday by the news that Andy Carroll could miss the rest of the season with a knee injury. The West Ham manager will also have to persist with midfielder Cheikhou Kouyaté in defence as centre-backs James Collins and Winston Reid are both still at least a week away from returning to full fitness. West Bromwich Albion, rejuvenated since Tony Pulis took charge in January, will fancy their chances, particularly now that their £10m record signing, Brown Ideye, has finally started to find his scoring touch. Rich Flower"
1157,Derby County,Reading,Fri 13 Feb 2015 18.22 GMT,2014-15,"This game could be a game for two strikers who were once among the leading scorers in the top flight. Darren Bent, on loan from Aston Villa, is expected to take the place of the injured Chris Martin in the Derby team while Yakubu Aiyegbeni is expected to feature for Reading after signing on a free transfer. A touch of Premier League class from either of them could make all the difference in a tight encounter. Rich Flower"
1158,Preston North End,Manchester United,Fri 13 Feb 2015 17.54 GMT,2014-15,"The Preston manager, Simon Grayson, and striker Jermaine Beckford have stunned Manchester United in the Cup once before, when their Leeds United team triumphed at Old Trafford in the third round five years ago. Beckford, the hero that day, is doubtful with an ear infection but Preston have regained momentum with three straight wins and are looking to become the second high-flying League One side to humiliate Louis van Gaal in domestic cup competition this season. Andy Hunter"
1159,Bradford City,Sunderland,Fri 13 Feb 2015 17.17 GMT,2014-15,"After conquering Chelsea at Stamford Bridge in the fourth round, can Phil Parkinson’s League One side do it again? Struggling in the top flight, Sunderland certainly look vulnerable while Gus Poyet has already voiced concerns about the state of Bradford’s pitch. Poyet, though, needs to win a few hearts and minds on Wearside after once again accusing Sunderland supporters of craving kick and rush football. Those comments have not gone down at all well with most fans vehemently disagreeing with him. Louise Taylor"
1160,Arsenal,Middlesbrough,Fri 13 Feb 2015 17.12 GMT,2014-15,"The holders will fancy their chances of reaching the last eight but this is by no means a straightforward assignment. Boro come in to this tie on the back of five successive league wins and buoyed by their stunning 2-0 win over Manchester City in the last round. Gabriel could make his debut at the back and Wojciech Szczesny will return in goal – with the Gunners the only side still fighting in the Cup and the Champions League, Arsène Wenger’s other changes will be interesting to see. John Ashdown"
1161,Crystal Palace,Liverpool,Fri 13 Feb 2015 14.45 GMT,2014-15,"Liverpool’s last visit to Selhurst Park, back in November, arguably proved a watershed moment in this campaign with Brendan Rodgers reshaping his side in the wake of that thumping. There have been only two defeats in 21 matches in all competitions since, the sense that it is their destiny to claim this competition and give Steven Gerrard a proper send off growing with each round. The captain will be absent injured in the fifth round and this appears awkward. The Merseysiders have not won at Palace in six attempts and Alan Pardew’s presence will conjure memories of Villa Park in 1990. This is a test. Dominic Fifield"
1162,Blackburn Rovers,Stoke City,Fri 13 Feb 2015 13.43 GMT,2014-15,"Fifty-three years have passed since these clubs last met in the Cup, a fourth-round tie won 1-0 at home by Stoke City, also the score the only other time they have faced each other in the competition, in 1906. Blackburn Rovers are the hosts on Saturday and the team currently placed ninth in the Championship should be wary of Stoke, who, despite losing 4-1 to Manchester City in midweek, were the better side before the break and are enjoying their best period of form for a while. Jamie Jackson"
1163,Manchester City,Hull City,Fri 6 Feb 2015 18.43 GMT,2014-15,"Manuel Pellegrini’s side have just endured a second bumpy patch of form in this title-defence season and as this one has left them five points behind Chelsea with only 15 games remaining a third cannot be afforded. The manager has all of his players fit – a rarity – so he has no excuse for not fielding the strongest XI and for not defeating Steve Bruce’s strugglers, who are third-bottom. Jamie Jackson"
1164,West Ham United,Manchester United,Fri 6 Feb 2015 18.20 GMT,2014-15,"Upton Park has been a difficult venue for visiting teams this season but Manchester United will fancy their chances given both of West Ham’s regular centre-backs, Winston Reid and James Collins, are doubtful with injuries. A chance, then, for Wayne Rooney to score for the first time in 2015, and perhaps from the halfway line, as he did during his last match at this stadium. Sachin Nakrani"
1165,Burnley,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 6 Feb 2015 17.57 GMT,2014-15,"Sean Dyche could name the same Burnley starting XI for the 10th Premier League game in a row, but Matt Taylor is pushing for a place in the squad after five months out. Darren Fletcher is set to go straight into a West Brom side looking to bounce back from their first defeat under Tony Pulis, who may decide to bench Saido Berahino after the striker’s ill-conceived interview this week. Rob Bleaney"
1166,Tottenham Hotspur,Arsenal,Fri 6 Feb 2015 17.16 GMT,2014-15,There were three north-London tussles last season and Arsenal won all of them while Tottenham went through another two managers. Mauricio Pochettino has been bold to play homegrown youth ahead of bigger names and has been rewarded. Both teams are on form and this promises to be another telling encounter between sides separated by one place and two points. Paul Chronnell
1167,Swansea City,Sunderland,Fri 6 Feb 2015 17.15 GMT,2014-15,"Given their recent struggles both sides head into this game buoyed by good away victories, with Sunderland finding goalscoring form to win their FA Cup replay at Fulham and Swansea shrugging off some midfield absentees to win impressively at Southampton. Jermain Defoe opened his Sunderland account last week, and his goals could just keep them out of the relegation battle. Paul Chronnell"
1168,Newcastle,Stoke,Fri 6 Feb 2015 17.12 GMT,2014-15,"It is some years since John Carver and Mark Hughes were on the same Pro Licence course but both men will be hoping to put theory into practice as Carver seeks his first home win since succeeding Alan Pardew. Much as Hughes has imbued Tony Pulis’s old Stoke side with new-found creativity, Carver’s side is rather more attack-minded than Alan Pardew’s, with the previously struggling – and often sidelined – Rémy Cabella suddenly blossoming under his guidance. Louise Taylor"
1169,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Fri 6 Feb 2015 17.11 GMT,2014-15,"Ron Vlaar’s return from injury will boost an Aston Villa defence which conceded five at Arsenal on Sunday. Joe Cole may also feature as Paul Lambert’s side seek a first league goal since 20 December. Chelsea, five points clear at the top and with their next four games against teams in the bottom half, welcome back Cesc Fàbregas but Diego Costa is still missing through suspension. Rob Bleaney"
1170,Leicester City,Crystal Palace,Fri 6 Feb 2015 17.10 GMT,2014-15,"Two home wins from 11 are a worry and though the loanee Robert Huth is suspended, Riyad Mahrez is back from Equatorial Guinea in one piece. Palace have included Keshi Anderson, 19, after he scored a six-minute hat-trick against them last week and one for the under-21s after signing from non-league Barton Rovers for £30k. ‘The headlights are still full-on for him,’ said Alan Pardew. Mark Tallentire"
1171,QPR,Southampton,Fri 6 Feb 2015 15.22 GMT,2014-15,"An ability to thrive despite upheaval is something that QPR would do well to learn from Southampton but on Saturday Rangers would much rather see Saints flop. Unfortunately for them, Ronald Koeman’s team travel to Loftus Road determined to atone for their unexpected defeat to Swansea and should be bolstered by the returns of some key players. But with Chris Ramsey and Les Ferdinand taking charge following the resignation of Harry Redknapp, there is hope of an upswing in form for QPR, too. Paul Doyle"
1172,Everton,Liverpool,Fri 6 Feb 2015 12.20 GMT,2014-15,"Brendan Rodgers’ jaw almost hit the floor when it was put to him that both Merseyside rivals head in to the 224th derby in a good run of form. Liverpool have won eight of their past 14 matches, Everton two in 14. Hence his astonishment. Everton did collect a crucial first win of 2015 at Crystal Palace last Saturday and will need to maintain the dogged defending of Selhurst Park as Steven Gerrard looks to bow out of this historic fixture emphatically. Andy Hunter"
1173,Manchester United,Leicester City,Fri 30 Jan 2015 18.25 GMT,2014-15,"There is even more intrigue than usual when Louis van Gaal names a Manchester United XI due to the manager’s constant chopping and changing of his personnel. This is causing the quite reasonable question: does the Dutchman, despite his vast experience, actually know his best team? The one he selected for the reverse fixture went down 5-3 to Leicester City on a September afternoon of crazy defending from Van Gaal’s side. A repeat at Old Trafford on Saturday afternoon and serious questions will surely be posed. Jamie Jackson"
1174,Chelsea,Manchester City,Fri 30 Jan 2015 17.49 GMT,2014-15,"José Mourinho has ‘empirical evidence’ that the world is against him. His star striker’s unwitting tread on the foot of an opponent has been ‘distorted’ into a stamping storm and suspension while the Chelsea manager himself is £25,000 lighter for having had the temerity to suggest that the world is indeed against him. He might be without not only Diego Costa but Cesc Fàbregas, who has a hamstring issue, against a City side who are having a wobble. Expect more fireworks. David Hytner"
1175,Liverpool,West Ham United,Fri 30 Jan 2015 17.36 GMT,2014-15,"Liverpool can leapfrog Sam Allardyce’s team with victory at Anfield, where West Ham United have not won in the league since The Beatles were at number one with ‘She Loves You’ in September 1963. Stewart Downing and Andy Carroll have a point to prove against the manager who ended their Anfield careers, Brendan Rodgers, but his team have taken 14 points from a possible 18 since losing to Manchester United and have Daniel Sturridge back for the first time since August. Andy Hunter"
1176,West Bromwich Albion,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 30 Jan 2015 17.03 GMT,2014-15,"One of Alan Irvine’s high points at The Hawthorns was victory at White Hart Lane in September, and completion of a league double would maintain Albion’s impressive form since Tony Pulis arrived. Pulis will want to avoid a repeat of last season’s meeting when the home side led Tottenham 3-0 only to draw. Spurs arrive just three points off 4th place, and will be buoyed by Wednesday’s testing League Cup semi-final win against Sheffield United. Charles Crook"
1177,Arsenal,Aston Villa,Fri 30 Jan 2015 16.02 GMT,2014-15,"Arsenal have their man in Gabriel Paulista and should the Brazilian defender feature in this one then it could prove to be the gentlest debut he has ever made. After all, he’d be facing a team who have scored just once in their last seven league games. Arsenal, in contrast, are full of goals and full of confidence having won four in a row, including a 2-0 triumph at Manchester City. Sachin Nakrani"
1178,Stoke City,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 30 Jan 2015 15.42 GMT,2014-15,"Stoke City are beginning to achieve some consistency, but have lost Bojan Krkic for the rest of the season to a knee injury. Mark Hughes’s task ahead of meeting his former employers is to find new inspiration in the Spaniard’s absence. Harry Redknapp also has a pressing mission to try to end QPR’s abysmal away form. The west Londoners have lost every single away league game so far, and another defeat will put their survival aspirations in more danger. Charles Crook"
1179,Hull City,Newcastle United,Fri 30 Jan 2015 14.52 GMT,2014-15,"Its been a poor start to 2015 for Hull City, who have failed to win since New Year’s Day. They are currently enduring a catastrophic run of injuries and Steve Bruce has openly criticised key players. Defeat to Newcastle United could send them bottom, but the away side have not won since Alan Pardew left. John Carver needs three points to quell doubts over his appointment. Charles Crook"
1180,Southampton,Swansea City,Fri 30 Jan 2015 14.35 GMT,2014-15,"With Wilfried Bony sold and Gylfii Sigurdsson suspended, Swansea travel to St Mary’s without the men responsible for most of their goals so far this season., leaving Gary Monk with plenty to medidate on as he ponders how to infiltrate the Premier League’s best defence Toby Alderweireld is still out injured for Southampton but Maya Yoshida has returned from international duty and could replace Florin Gardos in defence, while Sadio Mané could increase Saints’ firepower after coming back from the Africa Cup of Nations. The march of the Saints should continue. Paul Doyle"
1181,Sunderland,Burnley,Fri 30 Jan 2015 13.02 GMT,2014-15,"How many scouts will be watching Burnley’s much coveted Danny Ings? Might Jermain Defoe score his first goal in a Sunderland shirt? Can Gus Poyet preside over what would only be his team’s second Premier League win at the Stadium of Light all season? With the Uruguayan’s recent comments about Sunderland fans “living in the past” having not been well received on Wearside, Poyet desperately needs this classic relegation six pointer to conclude with a home win. Sean Dyche’s Burnley are unlikely to make it easy. Louise Taylor"
1182,Crystal Palace,Everton,Fri 30 Jan 2015 11.45 GMT,2014-15,"Crystal Palace have never enjoyed a league double over Everton, and have not beaten them at Selhurst Park since an Andy Preece goal secured victory in October 1994, but this would appear their best opportunity in a generation. Alan Pardew, who had scored a winner against the Merseysiders five years earlier, has won his four games in charge to date while Roberto Martínez’s team arrive with one win in 13 to their name. Level of points at start of play, b oth will consider this an opportunity to eke breathing space from the relegation cut-off. Dominic Fifield"
1183,Tottenham Hotspur,Leicester City,Fri 23 Jan 2015 20.36 GMT,2014-15,Tottenham were jaded in the scrappy 1-0 win against Sheffield United on Wednesday because of a taxing schedule requiring them to play nine times in January so Mauricio Pochettino is likely to shuffle his pack for this test. Nigel Pearson’s Leicester have played 12 fewer games but could do with some respite from their survival battle and will fancy their chances of capitalising on Spurs’ hectic fixture list. November 2000 was the last time one side failed to score in a meeting between these two. Alan Smith
1184,Sunderland,Fulham,Fri 23 Jan 2015 20.32 GMT,2014-15,"Could it be a tale of two strikers? While Sunderland’s Jermain Defoe makes his home debut, Kit Symons is keen to see how Fulham’s £11m Ross McCormack matches up in elite company. “Ross has never played in the Premier League but he has Premier League quality,” said the visiting manager. “It will be interesting to see how he does.” With Sunderland struggling in the top flight and Fulham mid-table in the Championship an upset is possible. Expect Gus Poyet to experiment with a new formation as he seeks the best way to accommodate Defoe. Louise Taylor"
1185,Southampton,Crystal Palace,Fri 23 Jan 2015 20.28 GMT,2014-15,"Southampton are primed for an assault on the FA Cup. They are unbeaten in eight matches and will be confident of reaching the fifth round at the expense of Crystal Palace, especially if Eljero Elia is in goalscoring form again. Palace, however, are likely to be stubborn opponents – Alan Pardew is yet to taste defeat since leaving Newcastle United and returning to Selhurst Park. Funnily enough, it was losing to Southampton on Boxing Day that prompted Palace to replace Neil Warnock with Pardew. Jacob Steinberg"
1186,Rochdale,Stoke City,Fri 23 Jan 2015 20.20 GMT,2014-15,"Stoke City, now among the top 30 richest clubs in the world, travel to the home of Rochdale, who have never been higher than English football’s third tier, although they have recently crept up to fifth place in League One. Keith Hill’s side knocked out Nottingham Forest in the last round so Mark Hughes will tell his Stoke team to be wary on what should be an invigorating Monday night of FA Cup football. Ryan Shawcross, who missed Stoke’s win at Leicester last week, could be back in the squad. Jamie Jackson"
1187,Preston North End,Sheffield United,Fri 23 Jan 2015 20.11 GMT,2014-15,"The meat in Sheffield United’s Capital One Cup semi-final sandwich is provided by Preston who, as a team in the same division, should have little to fear from Nigel Clough’s giantkillers, although North End were beaten at Bramall Lane in League One a fortnight ago. Clough could well opt to make changes with the second leg against Tottenham looming in midweek and Simon Grayson’s side will hope to take advantage of any cup overload on their opponents. John Ashdown"
1188,Manchester City,Middlesbrough,Fri 23 Jan 2015 20.08 GMT,2014-15,"Middlesbrough supporters may look back on the 8-1 defeat of City in May 2008 with fond memories but these clubs have since experienced contrasting fortunes. City, awash with money, have won two Premier League titles while Boro were relegated in 2009 and had to cut their budget as attendances at the Riverside fell away. It is only this season that they have looked capable of regaining a place in the top flight and this will be a fascinating test of their credentials against the very best. Rich Flower"
1189,Liverpool,Bolton Wanderers,Fri 23 Jan 2015 20.03 GMT,2014-15,"Bolton have progressed in six of eight FA Cup ties against Liverpool and any notion that a side 15th in the Championship cannot conjure a seventh success is undermined by Neil Lennon’s presence in the opposition dugout. The former Celtic manager has steered Wanderers away from the relegation zone since replacing Dougie Freedman in October through disciplined defending and by adding experience to the attack; 37-year-old Emile Heskey will be sure of a warm return to Liverpool, who are in confident mode. Andy Hunter"
1190,Derby County,Chesterfield,Fri 23 Jan 2015 19.58 GMT,2014-15,"A Derbyshire derby between the county’s two long-serving League clubs is a rare thing indeed – this is the first meeting of the sides separated by 21 miles for 29 years, and they have not been paired together in the FA Cup since 1948. Spireites supporters will be encouraged by the news that Steve McClaren is likely to rotate his squad with promotion his priority. Paul Cook’s team are going well in League One, however, and victory would rekindle talk of their 1997 semi-final heroics. Paul Chronnell"
1191,Chelsea,Bradford City,Fri 23 Jan 2015 19.55 GMT,2014-15,"There is a school of thought that with Wembley a home win away in the Capital One Cup and the prospect of a Champions League tie against PSG to negotiate alongside their title challenge, Chelsea may be happy to let the FA Cup go for a season. José Mourinho, however, has never been to that school. Bradford saw off Arsenal and Aston Villa to reach Wembley in the League Cup in 2013 – if the League One side were to add this scalp it would top even that achievement. Paul Chronnell"
1192,Cardiff City,Reading,Fri 23 Jan 2015 19.50 GMT,2014-15,Fans of these sides will be crossing their fingers that playing in the FA Cup leads to the form guide being dispatched through the nearest open window. Over the past six games in the Championship Cardiff and Reading have but one victory each to their name as both struggle with the pace of the division. Steve Clarke says he loves the FA Cup but the Reading manager has already admitted he will make changes to his starting XI for the trip to south Wales. Ian McCourt
1193,Bristol City,West Ham United,Fri 23 Jan 2015 19.41 GMT,2014-15,"Steve Cotterill views this tie against high-flying West Ham as reward for his players’ efforts during a gruelling pre-season training camp in South Africa and Botswana. Pretty much everything has gone right for Bristol City ever since. They sit joint top of League One and will hope to cause an upset in front of the television cameras and a sell-out crowd. West Ham, however, are seventh in the Premier League and ought to fancy their chances of a decent Cup run this season. Stuart James"
1194,Brighton & Hove Albion,Arsenal,Fri 23 Jan 2015 19.38 GMT,2014-15,"Arsenal’s challenge is to prolong the positive momentum generated by last weekend’s surprisingly clinical victory at Manchester City, which was so at odds with their previous approaches to daunting assignments. Arsène Wenger will not want to see his side endure the sort of scare they went through in this competition against Brighton two years ago, when they were made to work hard for a 3-2 win. Brighton have struggled in the league this season but picked up markedly since the arrival of Chris Hughton as manager and should prove tough to break down but, with Wenger likely to give starts to Mesut Özil and Theo Walcott as they continue their return from injuries, the Premier League side will be confident of prevailing. Paul Doyle"
1195,Blackburn Rovers,Swansea City,Fri 23 Jan 2015 19.26 GMT,2014-15,"Swansea, after suffering their heaviest defeat in over 20 years against Chelsea last week, will no doubt want to redeem themselves when they meet Blackburn Rovers on Saturday. Despite an emphatic 6-2 victory over Tranmere in the previous round, question marks surround the ability of Garry Monk’s side to hit the net following the sale of Wilfried Bony. His departure offers an opportunity to Bafétimbi Gomis but, as of yet, he has failed wholly to live up to expectations. Blackburn will relish the opportunity to host Premier League opposition as they look to strengthen their position in the Championship and push towards the play-off places. Henrietta Montague-Munson"
1196,Birmingham City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 23 Jan 2015 19.22 GMT,2014-15,"When these two sides last met, Roy Hodgson was in charge at The Hawthorns and Alex McLeish was Birmingham manager, and the Blues were also in the Premier League. How times have changed. Albion won that day and generally do when it comes to FA Cup games between these two rivals – Albion have gone through to the next round in six of the seven times they have met. Tony Pulis, however, may yet decide to prioritise Premier League survival over a run in the Cup. Ian McCourt"
1197,Aston Villa,AFC Bournemouth,Fri 23 Jan 2015 19.17 GMT,2014-15,"Might Eddie Howe’s high-flying Bournemouth have the best chance of causing a fourth-round upset? Before them on Sunday will be a struggling Aston Villa side who have scored one fewer league goal at home all season than Bournemouth did in October’s 8-0 trouncing of Birmingham City. The Cherries top the Championship despite losing their last match against Leeds United and, given the difficulty Paul Lambert’s men have in scoring at Villa Park, if Howe’s side can take the lead it could be their day. Jamie Jackson"
1198,Leicester City,Stoke City,Fri 16 Jan 2015 18.31 GMT,2014-15,"Leicester City start the weekend bottom of the Premier League, two points adrift of Hull City. Despite relegation looming large over the Foxes the mood in Leicester will have lifted recently with two wins in three and the signing of the prolific young Croatian striker, Andrej Kramaric. Stoke City were poor last time out against Arsenal and will have to improve to get a positive result. Graham Searles"
1199,Tottenham Hotspur,Sunderland,Fri 16 Jan 2015 18.00 GMT,2014-15,"Jermain Defoe looks set to start against his former club Tottenham Hotspur in his first game for new employers Sunderland. The visitors will hope that Defoe continues his record of scoring on debut for every club he has played for to help produce a shock result. Spurs, however, have a new talisman in Harry Kane and no doubt will rely on the Englishman to provide the difference. Graham Searles"
1200,West Ham United,Hull City,Fri 16 Jan 2015 17.31 GMT,2014-15,"Sam Allardyce was buoyed by West Ham’s epic FA Cup replay win over Everton on Tuesday and he now wants a tonic in the league, where his team have not won in four matches. His good friend, Steve Bruce, however, is in more desperate need. The Hull manager is enduring what he has called the worst injury crisis of his 17 years in management and, if results go against him on Saturday, his team could kick off at the bottom of the table. David Hytner"
1201,Swansea City,Chelsea,Fri 16 Jan 2015 17.18 GMT,2014-15,"José Mourinho will want nothing but all three points against Swansea City. Chelsea could potentially move further ahead of title rivals Manchester City as the latter could drop points against Arsenal. While Swansea will be relying on Bafétimbi Gomis to replace the goal threat of Wilfried Bony, the Frenchman may lack the quality needed to break down Chelsea’s solid defensive line. Graham Searles"
1202,Burnley,Crystal Palace,Fri 16 Jan 2015 16.57 GMT,2014-15,"Burnley and Crystal Palace have identical form for their past five league games and both find themselves hovering above the relegation zone on 20 points. Crystal Palace may feel they have the edge with Alan Pardew at the helm, but Sean Dyche will be supremely focused on producing a positive display after capitulating in the FA Cup to Tottenham in midweek. Graham Searles"
1203,Aston Villa,Liverpool,Fri 16 Jan 2015 16.23 GMT,2014-15,Aston Villa will look like easy targets to Liverpool despite being the away side and having a significantly depleted squad. Paul Lambert’s side are without a win in six league games and have not scored in their last four. Their new signing Carles Gil could make his debut from the bench and in doing so might provide Christian Benteke with some much-needed quality service in the final third. Graham Searles
1204,Queens Park Rangers,Manchester United,Fri 16 Jan 2015 15.57 GMT,2014-15,"Queens Park Rangers have not lost at home since October, but their past two results at Loftus Road, draws with Crystal Palace and Swansea City, have been disappointing and they have slipped back into the relegation zone. Manchester United will hope to plunge QPR into deeper trouble and will be determined to get back on track after last Sunday’s defeat against Southampton. With Robin van Persie injured, Radamel Falcao is set to return for United. Jacob Steinberg"
1205,Manchester City,Arsenal,Fri 16 Jan 2015 15.31 GMT,2014-15,"Sergio Agüero and Alexis Sánchez, arguably the season’s best players thus far, should share the same field in a contest Manchester City will be desperate to win as their next league outing is a title showdown with Chelsea at Stamford Bridge. Yet Arsenal will want a say: can Arsène Wenger’s team finally beat the champions on their own patch to end a five-year drought in north Manchester? Jamie Jackson"
1206,Everton,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 16 Jan 2015 14.32 GMT,2014-15,"Tony Pulis made a winning start to his Albion reign and will be looking to repeat last season’s success with Crystal Palace at Everton in his first away game in charge. There is no margin for error for Roberto Martínez. Everton are three points above the relegation zone, have won once in 12 games, have exited both domestic cup competitions at the opening hurdle for the first time in their history and are facing a difficult February. Andy Hunter"
1207,Newcastle United,Southampton,Fri 16 Jan 2015 12.59 GMT,2014-15,"Newcastle fly to Dubai on Sunday for a warm weather training break. John Carver - who turned 50 on Friday - will hope to board the plane celebrating his first victory since succeeding Alan Pardew in a caretaker capacity. Carver knows a win would enhance his chances of keeping the job until the end of the season but could have wished for less formidable opponents than Champions League challengers Southampton. Much may depend on the form of the returning Fraser Forster, the visiting goalkeeper and Newcastle academy graduate. Louise Taylor"
1208,Arsenal,Stoke City,Fri 9 Jan 2015 19.13 GMT,2014-15,"Many Arsenal fans may be more interested in what Arsène Wenger does in the transfer market this month than this game, but the pleas for the Frenchman to sign defensive and midfield reinforcements have thus far fallen on deaf ears. December’s defeat at Stoke was arguably the low point of a difficult season at the Emirates, and Mark Hughes will aim to make life uncomfortable again. Paul Chronnell"
1209,Manchester United,Southampton,Fri 9 Jan 2015 18.32 GMT,2014-15,As only one point separates Manchester United from Southampton Louis van Gaal will be keen to defeat the visitors as the race for the Champions League berths continues. This match may see the sight of Víctor Valdés on the bench for United for the first time after the former Barcelona keeper signed an 18-month deal to be David de Gea’s deputy as the club’s No2 goalkeeper. Jamie Jackson
1210,West Bromwich Albion,Hull City,Fri 9 Jan 2015 18.10 GMT,2014-15,"Tony Pulis has taken over at The Hawthorns and West Bromwich Albion are safe. That is the theory among many, although Pulis, who has never been relegated in his managerial career, is keen to guard against any complacency. After the 7-0 thrashing of Gateshead in the FA Cup in his first game in charge, the serious business starts for the Welshman with the visit of a Hull side depleted through injury but buoyed by festive wins over Sunderland and Everton.A tight game with few goals is anticipated. Stuart James"
1211,Sunderland,Liverpool,Fri 9 Jan 2015 17.41 GMT,2014-15,"Jordan Henderson and Simon Mignolet return to Wearside on a day when Brendan Rodgers will hope to move a little closer to the European places and Gus Poyet further away from the relegation zone. The divisional draw specialists, Sunderland are difficult to beat but have won only one of their past 10 Premier League games and are likely to be without the influential Lee Cattermole. Rodgers could do with Steven Gerrard marking what seems set to be his farewell appearance in the north-east with a reminder of his match-winning talents. Louise Taylor"
1212,Everton,Manchester City,Fri 9 Jan 2015 16.58 GMT,2014-15,"While Manuel Pellegrini has found different ways to win in the absence of his leading strikers, Roberto Martínez continues to search for one. The champions are unbeaten in 13 matches, winning 11, and could have Sergio Agüero, Edin Dzeko and Vincent Kompany back for the trip to what promises to be a tense Goodison Park. Everton were improved in their FA Cup tie with West Ham United on Tuesday but will require another level to prevent a fifth successive Premier League defeat. Andy Hunter"
1213,Crystal Palace,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 9 Jan 2015 16.32 GMT,2014-15,"Returning to league action for the first time since their exhilarating win over Chelsea, Tottenham will be confident of extending their seven-match unbeaten run but know they face a serious test in the form of a Palace side intent on embarking on a hot streak of their own under Alan Pardew. The question is a fresh approach and renewed optimism will be enough for Palace to compensate for the new manager’s chances are not helped by the absence of key duo Mile Jedinak and Yannick Bolasie, both of whom are away on international duty. Paul Doyle"
1214,Swansea City,West Ham United,Fri 9 Jan 2015 16.09 GMT,2014-15,Swansea begin life without top-scorer Wilfried Bony because of Africa Cup of Nations duty and with a £30m move to Man City beckoning. The Ivorian leaves a gaping hole in the Welsh side that most teams would find difficult to fill. All eyes turn to Bafétimbi Gomis and whether he can fill that gap. West Ham are aiming to return to winning ways after three games without a win. Yemi Abiade
1215,Chelsea,Newcastle United,Fri 9 Jan 2015 15.31 GMT,2014-15,"Chelsea were beaten 5-3 by Spurs on New Year’s Day and that could be bad news for Newcastle, who would be wise to prepare themselves for the backlash at Stamford Bridge. José Mourinho’s side were eight points clear of Manchester City in November, but are now top only on alphabetical order and they will be determined to quash any talk of them looking vulnerable. As for Newcastle, it is another chance for John Carver to throw his hat into the managerial ring. Jacob Steinberg"
1216,Burnley,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 9 Jan 2015 14.17 GMT,2014-15,"Charlie Austin will make his first return to Turf Moor in the Premier League as a QPR player having completed the unlikely hat-trick of scoring, assisting and being sent off when Rangers were 2-0 victors over Burnley in December. The hosts’ mini-revival has seen them draw with Manchester City, Newcastle and Spurs in their past three games in all competitions, but an elusive an elusive three points is a must against relegation rivals Hoops, who lost 30 last weekend in the FA Cup to giantkillers Sheffield United. Luke Weston"
1217,Leicester City,Aston Villa,Fri 9 Jan 2015 13.17 GMT,2014-15,"Leicester will be looking to extend their unbeaten run to what would be a season’s best four games in all competitions against a goal-shy Aston Villa who are winless in five, scoring only once in that period, and a total of just 11 times in the Premier League this season. Nigel Pearson will certainly be targeting a second home win of the campaign to lift his side off the foot of the table. Luke Weston"
1218,QPR,Swansea City,Wed 31 Dec 2014 18.44 GMT,2014-15,The fate of these clubs this season seems heavily linked to their dependency on their strikers. Charlie Austin has done wonders with the meagre service given to him while Wilfried Bony has enjoyed a much more regular supply from his Swansea team-mates. The Ivorian will be eager to help his team to victory before departing for the Africa Cup of Nations - especially with other clubs said to be watching him - while Austin will be hoping to receive far better help than he was given in Rangers’ miserable home draw with Crystal Palace three days ago. Paul Doyle
1219,Newcastle United,Burnley,Wed 31 Dec 2014 18.32 GMT,2014-15,"Burnley’s Sean Dyche must hope life after Alan Pardew begins badly for Newcastle United but caretaker manager John Carver has other plans. Given his big coaching break by Ruud Gullit back in 1998, Carver will see this as a job audition but must cope without Newcastle’s leading scorer, the suspended Papiss Cissé. Carver’s team selection should be intriguing but his defence must be mindful of Burnley’s Danny Ings. Louise Taylor"
1220,Stoke,Manchester United,Wed 31 Dec 2014 18.03 GMT,2014-15,"Stoke have been arguably more impressive away this season but will still be a sticky proposition for Manchester United, whose unbeaten run stretches to nine games – though they have drawn two of their past three. United have unpleasant memories of this fixture last season, when they were defeated 2-1, but will be determined to cling on to hopes of a surprise title challenge. Alan Smith"
1221,Southampton,Arsenal,Wed 31 Dec 2014 17.37 GMT,2014-15,"Arsenal enter the new year with wind in their sails. Arsène Wenger’s team have seven wins in nine matches, their injury woes have started to feel a little less chronic and they believe they can strike a blow in the Champions League race at St Mary’s. Southampton have stabilised after something of a wobble and will be after revenge for the last-minute 1-0 defeat at Arsenal on 3 December last month. David Hytner"
1222,West Ham,West Brom,Wed 31 Dec 2014 17.33 GMT,2014-15,"West Bromwich Albion will travel to Upton Park with in caretaker hands with Tony Pulis set to be unveiled, although Sam Allardyce has warned his West Ham United side not to use that as an excuse to become complacent. It is a big game for West Ham. Successive defeats against Arsenal and Chelsea saw them drop out of the top four and they will be desperate to get back on track against opponents who are a point above the bottom three. Jacob Steinberg"
1223,Tottenham,Chelsea,Wed 31 Dec 2014 17.17 GMT,2014-15,"Tottenham’s 3-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge in early December led to much head-shaking among the Spurs faithful, with the general consensus being that a coveted top-four place was beyond them. Four wins and two draws since see them still in the mix and this looks a pivotal game. The league leaders dropped points at Southampton on Sunday and will want to regain momentum. Paul Chronnell"
1224,Manchester City,Sunderland,Wed 31 Dec 2014 16.09 GMT,2014-15,"Manuel Pellegrini will be desperate to see his Manchester City team return to winning ways having thrown away a two-goal lead against Burnley. That draw meant they failed to close the gap on Chelsea, who had earlier drawn at Southampton. But the champions will fancy their chances against an inconsistent Sunderland – even without Sergio Agüero who tortured Gus Poyet’s team in the reverse fixture. Alan Smith"
1225,Liverpool,Leicester,Wed 31 Dec 2014 16.01 GMT,2014-15,"Liverpool produced their best attacking performance of the season in Monday’s win at home to Swansea and will look to add to that here. Steven Gerrard should come back into the side having been rested against Swansea, while Raheem Sterling will continue to lead the line against a Leicester side who won for the first time in 14 at Hull on Sunday but remain at the foot of the table. Alan Smith"
1226,Hull,Everton,Wed 31 Dec 2014 15.54 GMT,2014-15,"Hull have beaten Everton only once in seven Premier League matches; a far cry from their first eight meetings in league and cup, where the Merseysiders picked up just one win. Everton did the double over Hull last season but come into this on the back of three straight defeats. Nikica Jelavic will line up against his former club in a game both sides desperately need to win. Matthew Smith"
1227,Aston Villa,Crystal Palace,Wed 31 Dec 2014 15.50 GMT,2014-15,"Aston Villa hold the better overall head to head record from the 33 meetings between these two – winning 13 times to Palace’s 10. In the Premier League it is the Eagles, with Alan Pardew about to take charge, who hold the upper hand, with four wins in 11 meetings (Villa have 3), including last season’s double. Goals may be at a premium though – the hosts have scored only twice in their past five meetings with Palace, who have scored one in each of their last four visits. Matthew Smith"
1228,West Bromwich Albion,Manchester City,Wed 24 Dec 2014 15.13 GMT,2014-15,West Bromwich Albion face an incredibly difficult task in hosting Manchester City. Manuel Pellegrini must be elated with how his side are playing despite having a significantly depleted strike force. Alan Irvine will be buoyed by James Milner starting but with the quality Pellegrini has at his disposal in midfield this somewhat leftfield choice will probably not change the result. Graham Searles
1229,Chelsea,West Ham United,Wed 24 Dec 2014 13.44 GMT,2014-15,"Chelsea’s response to that first defeat of the season, at Newcastle, has been immaculate, with Monday’s success at Stoke a fourth successive win in all competitions to ensure they remain clear at the summit. West Ham, in the top four at Christmas for the first time since 1985, will provide another stern test of the hosts’ title aspirations even if it is 12 years since the Hammers last triumphed down the District Line. With Arsenal to follow on the 28th, these next two derby fixtures will offer an indication of the strengths of Sam Allardyce’s side. Dominic Fifield"
1230,Everton,Stoke City,Wed 24 Dec 2014 11.20 GMT,2014-15,"There were groans around Goodison Park over Everton’s laboured style of play even when 3-0 up against QPR last week and discontent has grown following an abject defeat by the same scoreline at Southampton. Roberto Martínez needs to find a settled, more incisive team fast and Stoke City, with only one win in their past six league games, would leapfrog Everton with a victory. Troubled times for both. Andy Hunter"
1231,Leicester City,Tottenham Hotspur,Wed 24 Dec 2014 11.15 GMT,2014-15,"Leicester City’s troubles continue and Nigel Pearson will be feeling some pressure as his side are without a win in 12 matches. Mauricio Pochettino, however, will be feeling much better after a run of three victories in all competitions. A win would be a long overdue Christmas present for the Foxes but against high-spirited Tottenham Hotspur it could be a long shot. Graham Searles"
1232,Arsenal,Queens Park Rangers,Wed 24 Dec 2014 11.05 GMT,2014-15,"There can be few Queens Park Rangers supporters who truly believe their side can take anything from a trip to the Emirates given they have lost all eight of their away league fixtures this season.

1233,Sunderland,Hull City,Wed 24 Dec 2014 11.02 GMT,2014-15,"Hull City are winless in 10, there have been behind-the-scenes problems featuring Hatem Ben Arfa and Paul McShane and the Stadium of Light is probably about the last place Steve Bruce would have wanted to visit on Boxing Day. Sunderland’s former manager is unlikely to be welcomed by his less than adoring public but Gus Poyet’s team remain short of wins themselves and could do with building on last Sunday’s morale-boosting victory at Newcastle. Hulls’s Ahmed Elmohamady and David Meyler will be keen to upstage their former Sunderland team-mates. Louise Taylor"
1234,Swansea City,Aston Villa,Wed 24 Dec 2014 11.00 GMT,2014-15,Swansea City welcome back top scorer Wilfried Bony to the starting lineup and their chances of beating Aston Villa are improved by that. Conversely Aston Villa lose Gabby Agbonlahor through suspension and Paul Lambert will no doubt be worried about his growing list of absentees. On current form Swansea should prevail but it would certainly be far from a Christmas miracle if Aston Villa shocked the home support. Graham Searles
1235,Manchester United,Newcastle United,Wed 24 Dec 2014 11.00 GMT,2014-15,"So impressive has been Manchester United’s resurgence under Louis van Gaal that the draw at Aston Villa was greeted by dismay by the manager and players after six consecutive wins in the league. Newcastle United arrive having lost their past two, a resounding 4-1 defeat at Arsenal and the late 1-0 Tyne-Wear derby reverse, so their manager, Alan Pardew, is once again in need-of-a-win mode. Jamie Jackson"
1236,Crystal Palace,Southampton,Wed 24 Dec 2014 11.00 GMT,2014-15,After a positive start to the season Crystal Palace have stalled and are hovering dangerously above the relegation zone. Meanwhile Southampton drew a line under their run of five defeats in all competitions with an emphatic 3-0 victory over Everton last weekend. Southampton will be looking to add another victory to that to strengthen their European ambitions. Graham Searles
1237,Burnley,Liverpool,Wed 24 Dec 2014 11.00 GMT,2014-15,"Liverpool failed to convert their dominance over Arsenal into three points last time out and Brendan Rodgers will be hoping for a much more efficient display at Turf Moor. Without Daniel Sturridge, though, they lack a consistent goal threat and never look like producing last season’s form. Sean Dyche is making progress at Burnley but he will be hoping Liverpool stumble again in his quest to move out of danger. Graham Searles"
1238,Aston Villa,Manchester United,Fri 19 Dec 2014 23.15 GMT,2014-15,"Manchester United will travel to Aston Villa in high spirits having won their previous six league games. While Paul Lambert has steadied the Villa team since a six-game losing streak, his side will have to improve to have any chance of a positive result. However Christian Benteke could provide them with a glimmer of hope when challenging the perpetually weakened United defence. Graham Searles"
1239,Newcastle United,Sunderland,Fri 19 Dec 2014 18.30 GMT,2014-15,"Alan Pardew is desperate to avoid becoming the first Newcastle manager to lose four straight derbies to Sunderland. He could do without having his novice third-choice goalkeeper, Jak Alnwick, protecting his defence. Not to mention being up against Gus Poyet. The Uruguayan was labelled “a scourge of this club” by Sir Bobby Robson when, as a Chelsea and Spurs player, he was prone to scoring against the Tynesiders. Key subplots include the likely midfield duel between Moussa Sissoko and Sunderland’s Lee Cattermole and the performance of Newcastle’s Jack Colback against his former employers. Louise Taylor"
1240,Hull City,Swansea City,Fri 19 Dec 2014 18.12 GMT,2014-15,Time is still on Steve Bruce and Hull City’s side but having not won in nine games the Tigers will be starting to worry. Swansea City is the perfect opportunity to gain some momentum but Garry Monk will have other ideas as the Swans also look to climb back up the table after two disappointing defeats. Hull need a spark in front of goal – what happened to new signing Abel Hernández? Graham Searles
1241,Tottenham Hotspur,Burnley,Fri 19 Dec 2014 17.45 GMT,2014-15,"This is not the most glamorous fixture on Tottenham’s calendar but in the context of their season, its importance cannot be overstated. The club fired a positive vibe at White Hart Lane with the midweek League Cup win over Newcastle, as they had done in the league victory against Everton, but on too many occasions Spurs have stumbled at home against teams that are below them in the table. Burnley have found form but Tottenham know that a win is essential. David Hytner"
1242,Manchester City,Crystal Palace,Fri 19 Dec 2014 16.56 GMT,2014-15,"Manuel Pellegrini has Sergio Agüero, Edin Dzeko and Stevan Jovetic all injured for this visit of Crystal Palace meaning the champions of England have no frontline striker available. The manager may field José Ángel Pozo in attack for a consecutive start as he is a forward by trade, or perhaps turn to James Milner, Samir Nasri or David Silva to knit the side together when moving forward. Pellegrini, though, can be delighted at being only three points behind Chelsea following their early season travails yet Neil Warnock’s Palace may prove awkward opposition. Jamie Jackson"
1243,Queens Park Rangers,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 19 Dec 2014 15.16 GMT,2014-15,"Alan Irvine will hope West Brom can use their victory in the derby last weekend as a springboard. The Baggies did not exactly blow Aston Villa away though, and Harry Redknapp will be well aware that QPR, in front of their own fans, can exploit his side. Is it to soon to call this a ‘six-pointer? Maybe, but both clubs need a victory to help spread the festive cheer. Graham Searles"
1244,West Ham United,Leicester City,Fri 19 Dec 2014 13.36 GMT,2014-15,"West Ham United will be confident of continuing their outstanding form. While Sam Allardyce’s side have risen to fourth place after losing one of their past 10, the goals have dried up for Leicester, who are without a win in 11. The pressure on their manager, Nigel Pearson, is increasing and only a win at Upton Park would give Leicester a chance of not being bottom at Christmas. Jacob Steinberg"
1245,Southampton,Everton,Fri 19 Dec 2014 13.03 GMT,2014-15,"Having suffered five defeats in a row including the midweek shock at Sheffield United and with some nasty fixtures to come at the turn of the year, Southampton could really do with a win. However they are so ravaged by injury and suspension that Toby Alderweireld may start in midfield to add steel. Everton arrive five places and points below them but travel to the south coast after overcoming a winless league run of four with a 3-1 victory over QPR on Monday. Alan Smith"
1246,Liverpool,Arsenal,Fri 19 Dec 2014 12.19 GMT,2014-15,"Brendan Rodgers finally found respite – and an effective formation – at Bournemouth but back in the Premier League it is a case of two managers needing to convince at Anfield. Arsène Wenger will shudder at the memory of his last visit, February’s 5-1 humiliation that holed his then Premier League leaders’ title credentials and reinforced Liverpool’s own in the process. Arsenal must also improve on their last away league display at Stoke City to avoid any nasty confrontations at Lime Street Station afterwards. Andy Hunter"
1247,Manchester United,Liverpool,Fri 12 Dec 2014 18.00 GMT,2014-15,David Moyes’s branding of Liverpool as favourites against Manchester United at Old Trafford for last season’s edition of this fixture hardly enamoured the Scot to fans. In Louis van Gaal they now have a manager to believe in and he “welcomes” Brendan Rodgers’ side seeking a six consecutive win. The Liverpool manager is feeling serious heat due to average domestic form and being knocked out of the Champions League and a victory over the auld enemy would be a fair fillip. Jamie Jackson
1248,Leicester City,Manchester City,Fri 12 Dec 2014 17.26 GMT,2014-15,Leicester will be dreading the arrival of Manchester City. Nigel Pearson’s side are bottom and struggling for form. Man City will be confident after qualifying for the knockout stages of the Champions League. Manuel Pellegrini will need to remind his players of what happened to Manchester United earlier this season to keep their focus on the task in hand. Graham Searles
1249,Swansea City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 12 Dec 2014 17.10 GMT,2014-15,"Swansea and Tottenham know all about the Europa League effect; last season it cost both clubs a manager and finishing where they wanted. Freed from its shackles, Swansea are eighth but need to recover from their damaging defeat at West Ham. Spurs have struggled after Thursday exertions before and the tiring Europa League trip to Turkey will have taken its toll but those excuses are wearing thin. Paul Chronnell"
1250,Arsenal,Newcastle United,Fri 12 Dec 2014 16.50 GMT,2014-15,Newcastle begin an important week with a visit to one of their bogey teams. They have beaten Arsenal only once in 17 meetings and Alan Pardew has lost on each of his three visits with the club to the Emirates. The 7-3 defeat in December 2012 was sobering but Newcastle are in confident mood after beating Chelsea and they want another tonic before the Capital One Cup tie at Tottenham and the derby against Sunderland next Sunday. David Hytner
1251,Crystal Palace,Stoke City,Fri 12 Dec 2014 16.20 GMT,2014-15,"While Stoke fans like nothing more than cheering on their team to victory over Arsenal, as they did last weekend, it is probably fair to say their manager would get particular pleasure from putting one over Neil Warnock’s team. Warnock riled Mark Hughes by suggesting he “destroyed” QPR after succeeding him in 2012 and the pair have had a frosty relationship ever since. Paul Doyle"
1252,Everton,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 12 Dec 2014 16.04 GMT,2014-15,"Both sides are in urgent need of victory for very different reasons. Everton have not won in three league games and home form is largely responsible for Roberto Martínez’s side falling behind the European hopefuls. Goodison Park has witnessed only two league wins this term but their injury list is clearing and John Stones could return after an ankle injury. Harry Redknapp’s strugglers have lost all seven away games, the worst record in the division. Andy Hunter"
1253,Sunderland,West Ham United,Fri 12 Dec 2014 15.51 GMT,2014-15,"The days when Sam Allardyce was a very traditional Sunderland centre-half are long ago. Should West Ham’s now ultra modern, European challenging manager involve Diego Poyet, the afternoon will assume an unusual feel for his father, Gus. Poyet Sr could do with three points as he strives to rebrand a Sunderland side who, although promising, remain a work in progress. Andy Carroll can expect a hot reception - but Allardyce’s former Newcastle United striker would relish scoring the winner. Louise Taylor"
1254,Chelsea,Hull City,Fri 12 Dec 2014 15.35 GMT,2014-15,"José Mourinho will see this as an opportunity to restore momentum after losing at Newcastle. Petr Cech will start given the muscular injury sustained by Thibaut Courtois, though that does not suggest weakness. Hull, with one win in 14 matches, arrive fragile if perhaps marginally encouraged by the points taken off Everton and West Brom in their past two fixtures. They have never won at Chelsea. Given they will begin the game below the relegation cut-off, this would be a timely occasion to make history. Dominic Fifield"
1255,Burnley,Southampton,Fri 12 Dec 2014 14.25 GMT,2014-15,"Having handsomely defied predictions of a relegation struggle, Southampton’s surprise top-four residency was ended after Monday’s defeat to Manchester United, a third successive loss. They will view this game as a chance to recover but Burnley, who saw their four-game unbeaten run ended at QPR last time out, have already shown the requisite battling qualities to stay in the top flight. Paul Chronnell"
1256,West Bromwich Albion,Aston Villa,Fri 12 Dec 2014 12.41 GMT,2014-15,West Brom have failed to win in their past five matches and have disappointed supporters with lacklustre performances. Alan Irvine will surely look to the derby atmosphere against Aston Villa to stir his side into life in order to secure a much-needed victory. Villa on the other hand are improving and Christian Benteke could hold the key for Paul Lambert to upset Albion. Graham Searles
1257,Tottenham Hotspur,Crystal Palace,Fri 5 Dec 2014 18.24 GMT,2014-15,"Tottenham suffered an inevitable reality check at Chelsea on Wednesday but they will seek to use the positivity that returned to White Hart Lane in the win over Everton last weekend. Mauricio Pochettino wants to see more sustained evidence that his philosophy is taking root and he will again be without Emmanuel Adebayor, who remains weak after a virus. Crystal Palace have promised to be positive. “If you go into away games thinking a point is good, you tend to lose,” Julián Speroni said. David Hytner"
1258,Southampton,Manchester United,Fri 5 Dec 2014 18.14 GMT,2014-15,"Successive defeats might have given Southampton an unwelcome wake-up call had their performance at Arsenal not been so impressive. They will consider a visit from Manchester United as an opportunity to regain lost momentum, though injuries are starting to test the depth of Ronald Koeman’s squad. Louis van Gaal will have no sympathy on that front given his own list of absentees. United have won four in a row and are upwardly mobile. This test is awkward, but less daunting than it would recently have appeared. Dominic Fifield"
1259,Stoke City,Arsenal,Fri 5 Dec 2014 17.54 GMT,2014-15,"There has been an extra needle to clashes between these teams ever since Aaron Ramsey suffered that horrendous injury following a tackle by Ryan Shawcross in 2010. Even before that Arsenal did not relish trips to the Britannia, where Arsène Wenger has won only once in seven attempts. But this might be a good time to visit, as Stoke are struggling with both injuries and form and have lost their last three leagues games. Nothing would give Stoke fans greater pleasure that run end against Arsenal. Paul Doyle"
1260,Hull City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 5 Dec 2014 17.18 GMT,2014-15,"Despite taking points at Liverpool and Arsenal in October, Hull lost all their November games to find themselves in the relegation zone on Tuesday. Steve Bruce was relieved after a 1-1 draw with Everton lifted them to 17th but the Tigers are still without a win in seven and a point behind the visitors, West Brom, who have lost their past four putting pressure on Alan Irvine to stop the rot. His side travel to the KC Stadium without the captain, Chris Brunt, who suffered a hamstring injury in their midweek defeat to West Ham. Amy Eustace"
1261,West Ham United,Swansea City,Fri 5 Dec 2014 16.46 GMT,2014-15,Neither of these sides were considered likely contenders for the European places back in August but they kick off on Sunday in fifth and seventh places respectively and are showing few signs of strain. Both clubs acted shrewdly in the summer – there haven’t proved to be too many better bargains than Gylfi Sigurdsson and Alex Song – and will be looking to do so again next month. Paul Chronnell
1262,Newcastle United,Chelsea,Fri 5 Dec 2014 15.45 GMT,2014-15,"José Mourinho may be the Special One but he is still to win a Premier League game at Newcastle. Even so, St James’ Park regulars have long wondered what might have been had Sir Bobby Robson got his way and succeeded in persuading the Portuguese to go there as his assistant back in the late 1990s. Mourinho and Alan Pardew are friends but Pardew would still relish celebrating Tuesday’s fourth anniversary of his installation as Newcastle manager by ending Chelsea’s unbeaten run. Louise Taylor"
1263,Liverpool,Sunderland,Fri 5 Dec 2014 15.14 GMT,2014-15,"Brendan Rodgers was under siege a week ago; now he is seeking a hat-trick of league wins for the first time since April. A back-to-basics approach has paid dividends for the Liverpool manager, who may again consider resting Steven Gerrard with a crucial Champions League game against Basel plus Manchester United to come next week. Sunderland have scored only five goals in six league away games this season and last won at Anfield in 1983. Andy Hunter"
1264,Manchester City,Everton,Fri 5 Dec 2014 14.37 GMT,2014-15,"Manchester City have hit good form when required and Everton are in the middle of an unwanted stumble so Manuel Pellegrini’s team will be confident of claiming three points from a fixture won home and away last season. The champions’ rousing 4-1 victory at Sunderland in the week was a third consecutive win while Everton’s 1-1 draw with Hull City meant Roberto Martinez’s side have a sole victory in their past five outings. Still, Everton arrive with Ross Barkley in their ranks, a player much admired by City. If is at his best the visitors have a chance. Jamie Jackson"
1265,Aston Villa,Leicester City,Fri 5 Dec 2014 13.47 GMT,2014-15,"Nigel Pearson desperately needs three points on Sunday having incurred the wrath of Foxes fans in the home defeat to Liverpool on Tuesday. His side have failed to win since beating Manchester United 5-3 in September. Villa, on the other hand, ended a run of nine games without a win at Selhurst Park on Tuesday. Their 1-0 victory came courtesy of a Christian Benteke strike and Paul Lambert will certainly hope that the forward is soon back to his old, sparkling self. Amy Eustace"
1266,Queens Park Rangers,Burnley,Fri 5 Dec 2014 12.34 GMT,2014-15,"Loftus Road is becoming a fortress for QPR, which is just as well given that they are yet to pick up a point on their travels. Harry Redknapp’s team are unbeaten in their past three home matches and they welcome another promoted side to west London after edging a thrilling encounter with Leicester City last Saturday. However Burnley, unbeaten in four matches, are starting to find their feet and they will hope that Danny Ings can inspire them again. Jacob Steinberg"
1267,West Bromwich Albion,Arsenal,Fri 28 Nov 2014 18.21 GMT,2014-15,Arsenal arrive at the Hawthorns off the back of a fine 2-0 victory against Borussia Dortmund in midweek and will hope to pick up where they left off. Olivier Giroud also makes his first start since August and the prospect of the Frenchman and Alexis Sánchez linking up must be daunting for West Brom. Alan Irvine will no doubt be hoping Arsenal show their usual defensive frailties. Graham Searles
1268,Burnley,Aston Villa,Fri 28 Nov 2014 18.10 GMT,2014-15,"Sean Dyche and Burnley will be feeling good as they prepare to face Aston Villa. They have won their last two matches and have moved off the bottom of the Premier League table. While Burnley have found some form, Aston Villa are without a win in eight. If Dyche masterminds a third victory then Burnley will leapfrog Aston Villa and most probably move out of the relegation zone. Graham Searles"
1269,Swansea City,Crystal Palace,Fri 28 Nov 2014 17.47 GMT,2014-15,"Swansea City will be looking to get back to winning ways when they entertain Crystal Palace on Saturday at the Liberty Stadium. The Swans were far from disgraced in last week’s defeat at Manchester City and Garry Monk will certainly hope for all three points. Crystal Palace will be looking to build on their victory over Liverpool after suffering four defeats in five before last weekend’s result, although they have won just once on the road in the Premier League this season. Jamie Ward"
1270,Southampton,Manchester City,Fri 28 Nov 2014 16.07 GMT,2014-15,Second hosts third in the game of catch-up with this a true test of these sides’ credentials. The visitors will hope to maintain momentum after their narrow victory against Swansea and late midweek triumph over Bayern Munich. Southampton secured a point at Aston Villa last time out but it is a mark of their progress to date this term that even a draw in the west Midlands felt wasteful. Their pedigree will be scrutinised in a tough schedule over the next month. There has been little evidence to date that they will be daunted. Dominic Fifield
1271,Manchester United,Hull City,Fri 28 Nov 2014 15.23 GMT,2014-15,"The Louis van Gaal project continues to rumble along, convincing in fleeting moments but lacking the consistent high-gear quality of the best Manchester United teams. Perhaps after the rousing win at Arsenal that derived from counterattacking play, Van Gaal’s side will click into a team able to perform for 90 minutes against visiting Hull City who will want to improve on recent form. Jamie Jackson"
1272,Sunderland,Chelsea,Fri 28 Nov 2014 15.11 GMT,2014-15,"Sunderland may appear in peril of reprising last season’s relegation skirmish but at least Gus Poyet knows how to beat José Mourinho. As a former Chelsea player, Poyet relished choreographing a 2-1 win at Stamford Bridge in April which ended Mourinho’s run of 77 undefeated home Premier League games during his two stints in charge in west London. As if that was not enough, Poyet’s players also knocked Chelsea out of last season’s League Cup. Can lightning strike thrice? “I’m hoping for an ugly evening with lots of wind and rain,” he says. Louise Taylor"
1273,Queens Park Rangers,Leicester City,Fri 28 Nov 2014 14.56 GMT,2014-15,QPR and Leicester City both look likely to be returning to the Championship next season on current form. It is early to call this a relegation six-point affair but Harry Redknapp and Nigel Pearson will be desperate for three points to secure leverage in the fight to stay up. QPR look early favourites as Leicester have not scored in five and are without a win in their past seven league games. Graham Searles
1274,Liverpool,Stoke City,Fri 28 Nov 2014 13.48 GMT,2014-15,"Steven Gerrard may be on the bench on the 16th anniversary of his Liverpool debut with Brendan Rodgers admitting prior to the Champions League draw with Ludogorets that three games in a week should not be expected of him. Whoever starts will be under pressure to deliver a first win in November for Liverpool and to respond to the manager’s demand for greater resilience. Stoke, smarting from last weekend’s home defeat by Burnley, have beaten Manchester City and Tottenham Hotspur on their travels this season. Andy Hunter"
1275,West Ham United,Newcastle United,Fri 28 Nov 2014 11.40 GMT,2014-15,"Sam Allardyce and Alan Pardew have both had their detractors but now West Ham and Newcastle are sixth and fifth in the league respectively. Life has rarely been this good and Pardew’s Newcastle will arrive at Upton Park in a confident mood after winning their past five matches. Allardyce reckons that only Chelsea would provide a bigger test at the moment, so he will be pleased to have Stewart Downing available again after he missed West Ham’s defeat at Everton last Saturday. Jacob Steinberg"
1276,Stoke City,Burnley,Fri 21 Nov 2014 18.20 GMT,2014-15,"Stoke City host a Burnley side who gained their first win of the season before the international break. Despite having to wait a little longer than they would have liked, Sean Dyche will be looking for a repeat performance as his side try to climb from the foot of the table. Mark Hughes, however, will be confident Stoke have enough quality to see off the Premier League newcomers. Graham Searles"
1277,Newcastle United,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 21 Nov 2014 18.06 GMT,2014-15,"Joey Barton returns to St James’ Park with QPR as a resurgent Newcastle aim for a sixth successive win in all competitions and a fourth straight clean sheet. Much more of this and Tynesiders will soon be singing about “Walking in a Pardew Wonderland”. Even so, Harry Redknapp – who must pray he can somehow emulate his Newcastle counterpart’s extraordinary renaissance – will be heartened by the raft of injuries, primarily in defence, which deprive the home side of some key performers including Fabricio Coloccini. Louise Taylor"
1278,Hull City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 21 Nov 2014 17.42 GMT,2014-15,"Hull City will want to pick themselves up after a deserved 1-0 defeat to Burnley in their last outing, a display considerably below what manager Steve Bruce has come to expect. Not much is better at Tottenham Hotspur. After Emmanuel Adebayor’s controversial comments that the players would rather play away, failure to win at the KC Stadium will leave them with nowhere to hide from their expectant fans. Yemi Abiade"
1279,Crystal Palace,Liverpool,Fri 21 Nov 2014 17.25 GMT,2014-15,"They have mockingly dubbed May’s nine-minute, three-goal capitulation as “Crystanbul” in south London and Liverpool will be haunted by memories of that evening upon Sunday’s return to Selhurst Park. The visitors have actually won only once at Palace in 20 years but, while their own season has been stodgy, they will confront hosts whose recent form is unrecognisable from that which propelled Tony Pulis’s team to safety last term. One point from five is a miserable return and they could be in tbe bottom three come kick-off. Liverpool will be after revenge. Dominic Fifield"
1280,Arsenal,Manchester United,Fri 21 Nov 2014 17.21 GMT,2014-15,"This could be anything. Both clubs ought to have strengthened more in defence and, as they lag outside the top four, the search for momentum has been held up. Arsenal have won two of the previous 18 meetings and, as the home team, their need for the win is probably greater. United, though, are also desperate. “You have to look further than the table and at the quality of the players,” Arsène Wenger suggested. “It’ll be a very exciting game.” David Hytner"
1281,Aston Villa,Southampton,Fri 21 Nov 2014 16.38 GMT,2014-15,"Going by the form book, this should be a walk in the park for Saints. Ronald Koeman’s side have won 11 of their last 12 matches in all competitions and will arrive at Villa Park second in the table. They are full of confidence. Aston Villa, on the other hand, have picked up one point out of a possible 21 – a goalless draw at Upton Park last time out – and are without three central defenders through injury as well as the suspended Christian Benteke. Stuart James"
1282,Leicester City,Sunderland,Fri 21 Nov 2014 16.24 GMT,2014-15,"While not yet a relegation six-pointer, this game may have a hand in determining which of the two teams stays in the Premier League. Leicester entertain Sunderland having lost four of their past five league games in poor fashion. They will need striker Leonardo Ulloa, who has not netted since September, to regain the golden touch that saw him score freely earlier in the season. A Sunderland win will do much to boost morale in Gus Poyet’s side before fixtures against Chelsea, Manchester City and Liverpool. Yemi Abiade"
1283,Chelsea,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 21 Nov 2014 16.14 GMT,2014-15,"With no other team yet looking compete, only injuries or complacency look likely to disrupt Chelsea’s unrelenting march toward the Premier League title. But even with a doubt hanging over the participation of Cesc Fàbregas, José Mourinho’s men are more than likely to prove too strong for Alan Irvine’s West Bromwich Albion side who have been stuttering over the last month. Paul Doyle"
1284,Manchester City,Swansea City,Fri 21 Nov 2014 16.04 GMT,2014-15,"The eight-point gap to Chelsea has the champions playing an unwanted game of catch-up in November. Swansea City arrive only three points behind Manchester City so Manuel Pellegrini, who may well be without Vincent Kompany and David Silva, will be wary of Garry Monk’s side. As Bayern Munich are at the Etihad Stadium on Wednesday for a must-win Champions League encounter City will not want a confidence-sapping afternoon. Jamie Jackson"
1285,Everton,West Ham United,Fri 21 Nov 2014 15.18 GMT,2014-15,"Neither Sam Allardyce nor Roberto Martínez will have enjoyed the recent internationals as both sides have considerable injury concerns. Allardyce’s biggest headache is that his star striker, Diafra Sakho, and partner Enner Valencia may both miss out. If they do then Everton’s defence will breathe a sigh of relief as the pair have been instrumental in West Ham’s excellent form this season. Graham Searles"
1286,Swansea City,Arsenal,Fri 7 Nov 2014 18.14 GMT,2014-15,"One for the purist. Arsenal travel to Wales eager to get back on track after that chastening experience against Anderlecht in midweek, when they surrendered a 3-0 lead, prompting Paul Merson to describe his former club as “tactically clueless”. With Mathieu Debuchy, Laurent Koscielny and Mikel Arteta sidelined, Swansea may fancy their chances of inflicting some more pain on Arsène Wenger and his players, especially with Wilfried Bony in form. The striker is set to sign a new deal on the eve of this game. David Hytner"
1287,West Ham United,Aston Villa,Fri 7 Nov 2014 17.42 GMT,2014-15,"Of all the possible problems West Ham might have faced in early November, complacency was not one many fans foresaw. But with West Ham riding high and dreaming of Europe, and Aston Villa having lost six on the spin, Sam Allardyce has had to call for focus. Christian Benteke is suspended and Villa have scored only five goals all season. They are desperate for any sort of foothold. David Hytner"
1288,Tottenham Hotspur,Stoke City,Fri 7 Nov 2014 16.44 GMT,2014-15,"Tottenham have lost three out of their last four Premier League matches at White Hart Lane, which underlines how tough it has been to establish confidence in the early months of the Mauricio Pochettino era. and Morale was particularly low during the last of those defeats, at home to Newcastle. Having racked up three wins since, with Harry Kane a scorer in each game and looking increasingly like White Hart Lane’s knight in shining armour, the clamour for the youngster to start in the Premier League is surely irresistible. Stoke have won once in the last month. Amy Lawrence"
1289,Liverpool,Chelsea,Fri 7 Nov 2014 16.14 GMT,2014-15,"Brendan Rodgers claims to be under no extra pressure against Chelsea following that team selection against Real Madrid but scrutiny of his methods will intensify without a positive result against the unbeaten Premier League leaders. He is acutely aware of that. Liverpool’s display at the Bernabéu has been subject to Malcolm Tucker-esque spin since Tuesday, but the fact remains they require a vast improvement to inflict defeat on Chelsea, themselves in need of a jolt after their levels dropped against QPR and Maribor. Andy Hunter"
1290,Manchester United,Crystal Palace,Fri 7 Nov 2014 15.50 GMT,2014-15,"Louis van Gaal feels “lousy” about Manchester United’s position so surely Crystal Palace before a packed Old Trafford offers the chance to take three points and start a pleasing run of results? The manager was in pugnacious mood on Friday yet injuries to Jonny Evans, Marcos Rojo and Phil Jones plus Chris Smalling’s suspension means Michael Carrick may be used as a stop-gap central defender. Neil Warnock’s side are bound to make life awkward, too. Jamie Jackson"
1291,QPR,Manchester City,Fri 7 Nov 2014 15.17 GMT,2014-15,"After their shambolic defeat to CSKA Moscow there is no doubt Manchester City are teetering close to a crisis. Manuel Pellegrini’s side are all but out of the Champions League and, despite victory in the Manchester derby, are struggling domestically. Queens Park Rangers need to be defeated but their display at Chelsea suggests this will be a test for the champions. Sachin Nakrani"
1292,Southampton,Leicester City,Fri 7 Nov 2014 14.29 GMT,2014-15,"Five matches without a win since their rousing victory over Manchester United has sent Leicester into the bottom three and Nigel Pearson must be concerned his team have not scored in their past three matches. Not the ideal time to be visiting the Premier League’s tightest defence then, but at least Leicester could start striker Leonardo Ulloa, who has recovered from the niggle that hampered him last week. That, however, is unlikely to be enough to disrupt Southampton’s serene progress up the league. Paul Doyle"
1293,Sunderland,Everton,Fri 7 Nov 2014 14.05 GMT,2014-15,"How will Sunderland cope without the suspended Lee Cattermole? Can Everton recover from their Thursday night Europa League exertions in time to win away? Might Gus Poyet’s side struggle in the absence of Patrick van Aanholt, their only recognised left-back? Is Jack Rodwell ready to remind Everton how much they are missing him after a disappointing start on Wearside following his £10m summer move from Manchester City? But will Rodwell even start? And can Sunderland avoid registering a fifth own goal of the season? Louise Taylor"
1294,Burnley,Hull City,Fri 7 Nov 2014 13.33 GMT,2014-15,"The problem with Burnley’s winless beginning to life back in the top flight – apart from it seeming to guarantee an instant return to the Championship – is that the longer it goes on, the more they will look at games such as Saturday’s and think: “This is the day.” Their manager, Sean Dyche, will hope so, but Hull are playing a lot better than 14th suggests. So Saturday may not be the day. Again. Paul Chronnell"
1295,Crystal Palace,Sunderland,Fri 31 Oct 2014 18.37 GMT,2014-15,"Gus Poyet’s Sunderland have conceded 10 goals in their last two league games. The Uruguayan coach will desperately want to mastermind a change in fortunes for the Black Cats against Crystal Palace who have also been less than impressive recently. Palace are hovering above the relegation zone alongside Sunderland, so a positive result for either could be crucial. Graham Searles"
1296,Manchester City,Manchester United,Fri 31 Oct 2014 18.22 GMT,2014-15,Manchester City desperately require victory following the three-match wobble that has included defeat in the past two games plus a draw. The nightmare scenario for the champions is to go down to Manchester United before their home crowd. Do so and Manuel Pellegrini will have a crisis on his hands ahead of the Champions League match against CSKA Moscow on Wednesday. Jamie Jackson
1297,Leicester City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 31 Oct 2014 18.15 GMT,2014-15,Leicester City will want to return to winning ways against West Bromwich Albion and reverse the downward spiral they have found themselves falling into in recent weeks. West Brom’s Seido Berahino is the man to stop for Leicester City in order to secure a victory and quite possibly a clean sheet. The young British striker has been the Baggies’ only goal threat this season. Graham Searles
1298,Aston Villa,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 31 Oct 2014 18.08 GMT,2014-15,"Tottenham travel to Villa Park desperate to make amends for their defeat by Newcastle last Sunday. A comfortable midweek win in the League Cup was scant consolation for surrendering a 1-0 lead at home to Alan Pardew’s strugglers. Aston Villa are on a five-game losing streak – but a win would lift them above Spurs and provide solace for their under-pressure manager, Paul Lambert. Toby Moses"

However the Hammers rest Diafra Sakho, a decision that will no doubt please Mark Hughes and Stoke City. Both sides have previously been labelled long-ball merchants but with West Ham’s recent attacking threat and Stoke missing Peter Crouch, the game could exceed expectations. Graham Searles"

They did recently. Why shouldn’t they expect?” A west-London derby might, indeed, eke an away performance from Harry Redknapp’s team against the leaders. Diego Costa will return as Chelsea aim to avoid an upset. Dominic Fifield"

Burnley have scored only five goals in nine league games and they are likely to adopt a familiar defensive approach, in order to retain a puncher’s chance. The onus is all on Arsenal to find the way through Burnley. They are desperate to find consistency. David Hytner"

Delighted as Rodgers has been to see his pal dodge the sack as Newcastle have, against all odds, won three consecutive games, he could do with a victory in what his Newcastle counterpart deems one of this division’s most “romantic” fixtures. If all eyes are on Mario Balotelli, a key sub-plot could revolve around the performances of rival wingers Raheem Sterling and Rolando Aarons. Louise Taylor"
1305,Manchester United,Chelsea,Fri 24 Oct 2014 17.36 BST,2014-15,"Louis van Gaal insisted that Manchester United can catch Chelsea but victory for José Mourinho’s team at Old Trafford would see a 13-point gap opened up between the two. Diego Costa remains a doubt and Loïc Rémy is definitely ruled out, meaning Mourinho may lead the line with André Schürrle, who returns from illness. Wayne Rooney remains suspended for United. Alan Smith"

1307,Tottenham Hotspur,Newcastle United,Fri 24 Oct 2014 17.00 BST,2014-15,"The pressure is not exactly off Alan Pardew, as he heads back to his home-town of London to face Tottenham but last Saturday’s home win over Leicester bought the Newcastle manager some respite. The long overdue first league victory of the season has, in Pardew’s words, given the club “the chance to build something” but the road ahead still looks long and arduous, and it will not be easy in the post-rabona landscape at White Hart Lane.

Insults have been traded between Harry Redknapp and Adel Taarabt via the press, and even Tony Fernandes was forced to wade in to quell the storm. It remains to be seen if Taarabt, described as three-stone overweight by his manager, will be selected here. QPR have won only once this season but Villa are in poor form themselves, losing four in succession. James Riach"
1309,Liverpool,Hull City,Fri 24 Oct 2014 15.53 BST,2014-15,"Mario Balotelli should keep his place in Liverpool’s starting lineup because of the limited options available to Brendan Rodgers, despite enduring a week of criticism after below-par performances against QPR and Real Madrid. The Italian may be encouraged by the fact Hull have shipped 10 goals in their three most recent trips to Anfield. Will this be the afternoon things fall in to place? Alan Smith"
1310,West Bromwich Albion,Crystal Palace,Fri 24 Oct 2014 15.00 BST,2014-15,"West Brom came desperately close to beating Manchester United on Monday, before Daley Blind rescued a point for the visitors.

Atonement is demanded but Poyet’s team could probably have done without a visit from Arsenal at this delicate juncture. At least a mixture of injuries and Jack Wilshere’s suspension means Arsène Wenger is without nine first-teamers including Mesut Özil, Olivier Giroud and Theo Walcott. That just leaves Aaron Ramsey, Santi Cazorla and one time Sunderland loanee Danny Welbeck to cope with. Louise Taylor"
1312,Southampton,Stoke City,Fri 24 Oct 2014 14.07 BST,2014-15,"It would be an understatement to say that Southampton are going to struggle to better their performance last week. The 8-0 win over Sunderland was the most eye-catching result of the season so far but it is unlikely that there is going to be a repeat against Stoke City, who should provide a sturdier test for Ronald Koeman’s side. For Koeman, the challenge is to ensure his players maintain those high standards. Jacob Steinberg"
1313,Swansea City,Leicester City,Fri 24 Oct 2014 13.46 BST,2014-15,"Swansea took nine points from nine in their opening three games but are now without a win in five.

That result at the Britannia aside, they have failed to score in their other three games away from home. Both sides are badly in need of a morale-boosting win. Alan Smith"
1314,West Ham United,Manchester City,Fri 24 Oct 2014 13.36 BST,2014-15,"A critical and very difficult match for City, who crave a win in the early kick-off to edge closer to Chelsea before the league leaders’ game at Old Trafford. City were guilty of slipping into slackness in the second half of their Champions League clash with CSKA Moscow in midweek, and West Ham are as capable as the Russians of punishing them if they relapse. West Ham’s defence has been excellent all season but the in-form Sergio Agüero will give them their biggest test; though in Diafra Sakho and Enner Valenica, the Hammers have top strikers of their own. A fascinating contest is in store. Paul Doyle"

Yet Queens Park R,angers rock bottom and in dismal form, should not pose them too many problems. Liverpool have been boosted by Daniel Sturridge’s return from injury, while Raheem Sterling has a point to prove after the nonsense of the past week. Jacob Steinberg"
1318,Manchester City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 17 Oct 2014 18.32 BST,2014-15,Manuel Pellegrini insists that this year’s Spurs vintage are a different proposition following the arrival of Mauricio Pochettino as the manager but with Chelsea showing little sign of any early-season fade Manchester City really must beat the visitors to maintain pressure. Yaya Touré is in the match-day 18 and may well have to start despite Tuesday’s trip to Russia for the vital Champions League match against CSKA Moscow. Jamie Jackson
1319,Everton,Aston Villa,Fri 17 Oct 2014 18.23 BST,2014-15,"Aston Villa have faltered after an impressive start, suffering three straight defeats, so this could be a chance for Everton to revive their season with a win. But, if statistics are anything to go by, there are plenty of other teams that Roberto Martínez would rather face: last season’s 2-1 win was the first time that Everton have beaten Villa at Goodison Park in the top flight since March 2006.

Combine that with West Ham’s uncharacteristically sloppy defending and surprisingly incisive attacking thus far this season and there should be goals. So put your money on a 0-0 draw. Rich Flower"
1321,Arsenal,Hull City,Fri 17 Oct 2014 16.38 BST,2014-15,"Arsenal continue to be hit by serious injuries as now Mesut Özil faces a long lay off with a knee injury and Laurent Koscielny is sidelined leaving Nacho Monreal to fill in at centre back. Hull will be buoyed by Arsène Wenger’s woes and will want to build on their first home win of the season in their last outing. Wenger will still be confident, though, that his misfiring Gunners’ superior attacking force can secure a much needed victory. Graham Searles"
1322,Newcastle United,Leicester City,Fri 17 Oct 2014 16.20 BST,2014-15,"Alan Pardew’s 700th game as a manager is a “must win” fixture. With his Newcastle United side seeking their first Premier League victory of the season and the club’s owner Mike Ashley once again expected to be in attendance, Pardew cannot afford another slip in front of a potentially hostile home crowd. Nigel Pearson, who served as assistant manager at St James’ Park under Sam Allardyce, will be anxious to exploit any edginess among those wearing black and white as he seeks to extend Leicester’s promising start to Premier League life.

Paul Doyle"
1324,Crystal Palace,Chelsea,Fri 17 Oct 2014 16.02 BST,2014-15,"It was Chelsea’s inability to win matches of this kind last season which cost them a league title, Palace winning courtesy of a John Terry own goal back in the Spring to start a five-match winning run that took them to safety. José Mourinho will take a squad wounded by international efforts but steeled to avenge that first league loss to these local opponents in 24 years.Dominic Fifield"
1325,Sunderland,Stoke City,Fri 3 Oct 2014 18.31 BST,2014-15,"While attention focuses on Alan Pardew’s travails up the road at Newcastle it has almost gone unnoticed that Sunderland, too, have still to win a league game this season. This leaves Gus Poyet’s side doubly anxious to atone for Stoke’s recent 2-1 League Cup win on Wearside but whatever happens Mark Hughes is likely to cast covetous glances at Lee Cattermole. Poyet says persuading his board not to sell Sunderland’s enforcer to Stoke last January ranks as his best piece of transfer business. Louise Taylor"

Nigel Pearson will hope that their in-form new striker Ulloa can again provide the difference as he has done so often this season. Burnley, however, are desperate for goals and will need to bag a couple to get a result against free-scoring Leicester. Graham Searles"
1327,Aston Villa,Manchester City,Fri 3 Oct 2014 18.12 BST,2014-15,Aston Villa’s momentum has been checked by consecutive 3-0 defeats by Arsenal and Chelsea but they may feel this is a good time to play Manchester City. Paul Lambert’s side won this fixture last season and they will hope that the champions are feeling sore after the disappointment of their 1-1 draw with Roma in the Champions League on Tuesday. But Manuel Pellegrini will back his forwards to produce the goods. Jacob Steinberg

Rangers, Redknapp admits, “need to tighten up” but, with the second worst goalscoring record in the league, they must find a few more goals too. West Ham have been something of a mixed bag thus far, but will fancy their chances of picking up a third win of the season. John Ashdown"
1331,Tottenham Hotspur,Southampton,Fri 3 Oct 2014 16.30 BST,2014-15,"This was not supposed to happen after Mauricio Pochettino swapped Southampton for Spurs and the south coast club lost five key men in the summer. But Pochettino will welcome his former team who are sitting second in the table, five points better off than Tottenham. Moreover, they are in a tactical groove under Ronald Koeman as Pochettino battles to instil his philosophy at White Hart Lane. It could be an uncomfortable afternoon for the Argentinian.

This team were thrashed 6-0 in the corresponding fixture back in March in the manager’s 1,000th game in charge, and Arsène Wenger has yet to defeat a José Mourinho side in 11 previous meetings. This is a contest between the division’s two remaining unbeaten teams: it would be a timely occasion for Wenger to break that duck. Dominic Fifield"
1333,Swansea City,Newcastle United,Fri 3 Oct 2014 15.20 BST,2014-15,Considering the turmoil surrounding Newcastle United it is difficult to look past a solid Swansea side who will aim to capitalise on their opponents’ complete lack of confidence. Alan Pardew has lost the support of the Newcastle fans but if he manages to produce an improbable first win away against Swansea then there still could be a glimmer of hope for his tenure on Tyneside.

Maybe the Liverpool boss will regret not picking up Danny Welbeck instead. However if Balotelli turns around Liverpool’s recent run of poor form by spearheading a first league win in four games against an improving West Brom side then, you can be sure, Rodgers and Liverpool fans will be smiling again.

Cissé’s two goals against Hull last Saturday may have saved the Newcastle manager’s job – at least for now – but Pardew might have been under a lot less pressure if the Senegal striker had contributed more than 21 minutes of playing time so far this season. Stoke, usually so solid at the Britannia Stadium, have lost both their home league games and could be vulnerable. Rich Flower"

And 3-1 was the scoreline when West Ham dismantled Liverpool last time out. Not for the first time – and probably not the last – this term, Van Gaal and his band need a victory desperately so the number three can again be enjoyed. Jamie Jackson"

1349,Swansea,Southampton,Fri 19 Sep 2014 16.13 BST,2014-15,"There have been just five goals in the four Premier League games between these two. Southampton won both games last season to nil and will be looking to win three games on the spin for only the third time since returning to the top flight. Swansea have the most settled side in the league – Garry Monk has used only 16 players – but will need Gylfi Sigurdsson, who has four assists already to his name, to be on form if they are to maintain their 100% home record. Alan Smith"
1350,West Ham United,Liverpool,Fri 19 Sep 2014 15.42 BST,2014-15,"Liverpool were the only English team to win in the Champions League last week but their display was unconvincing, which mirrors how they have performed domestically this season. Defeat to Aston Villa was particularly painful for the Merseyside club, who will be keen to get back to winning ways against a West Ham side who have lost each of their last three home fixtures. Sachin Nakrani"
1351,QPR,Stoke City,Fri 19 Sep 2014 14.25 BST,2014-15,"Mark Hughes returns to Loftus Road for the first time since being sacked by QPR nearly two years ago and will be eager for his Stoke side to play to their impressive potential following an inconsistent start to the season. QPR, meanwhile, need to recover from last week’s drubbing at Manchester United and show signs that they really are much better off than when Hughes was in charge of them. Defeat in this match would be alarming for either manager. Paul Doyle"
1352,Everton,Crystal Palace,Fri 19 Sep 2014 14.02 BST,2014-15,"Crystal Palace dealt a severe blow to Everton’s hopes of qualifying for the Champions League at Goodison Park in April and will be first to test the impact of the Europa League on Roberto Martínez’s players this term. The Everton manager named an unchanged side for Thursday’s defeat of Wolfsburg but with Samuel Eto’o impressing as a substitute, Darron Gibson fit again plus difficult trips to Swansea City and Liverpool to come next week, he may not opt for tried-and-trusted again. Andy Hunter"
1353,Newcastle United,Hull City,Fri 19 Sep 2014 13.33 BST,2014-15,"Alan Pardew’s first meeting with David Meyler since he head-butted the Hull midfielder is likely to be a mere footnote to a potentially toxic afternoon. Home fans are expected to demand their manager’s head but Pardew – who accuses his detractors of “mass hysteria” – has resolved to stand firm. Despite his loan from Newcastle dictating he cannot play here, Hatem Ben Arfa will be in the away dugout with his presence promising to add spice to a match Bruce may regard as an audition. Louise Taylor"
1354,Burnley,Sunderland,Fri 19 Sep 2014 13.29 BST,2014-15,"After 0-0 draws against Manchester United and Palace, Burnley could become the first team since Blackburn in December 2009 to record a hat-trick of scoreless draws here. Sean Dyche will be buoyed by the knowledge that Sunderland are one of three sides yet to keep a clean sheet. Three of their four games have been 1-1 at half-time but they have lost only once in their last five road trips. Alan Smith"
1355,West Bromwich Albion,Everton,Fri 12 Sep 2014 19.25 BST,2014-15,Everton and West Brom's form is identical so far this season but Roberto Martínez will be confident as his side have scored freely in their opening games. Alan Irvine will also be spurred on by Everton's crippling defensive frailties that have led the side to concede ten goals in their opening three games. Romelu Lukaku will feel at home at the ground where he had a successful time on loan two seasons ago and will look to use this to power Everton to their first win this season. Graham Searles
1356,Stoke City,Leicester City,Fri 12 Sep 2014 19.21 BST,2014-15,Stoke will be still be riding high after completing a shock away victory against Man City last time out. They will be doubly buoyed by the fact they are unbeaten against Leicester in their last five meetings at the Britannia Stadium. Nigel Person's Leicester are still searching for a win this season but strong showings against Everton and Arsenal this season mean it should come soon for the Foxes. Graham Searles
1357,Manchester United,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 12 Sep 2014 19.18 BST,2014-15,"Can Louis van Gaal finally win a first Manchester United game at the fifth attempt? And will he change the 3-5-2 shape that has been so sluggish and unconvincing? These are the pressing issues for the Dutchman as a Queens Park Rangers containing Rio Ferdinand roll into an Old Trafford that has become the Theatre of Nightmares rather than its more famous moniker.This could be the start of a star-studded United era as Radamel Falcao, Angel Di Maria, Wayne Rooney, Robin van Persie and Juan Mata all vie for a starting berth in Van Gaal’s XI. United, surely, cannot fail to win again, can they? Jamie Jackson"
1358,Liverpool,Aston Villa,Fri 12 Sep 2014 19.14 BST,2014-15,"Something about Anfield sparks the best in Paul Lambert's Aston Villa, who were 2-0 up last season and on course to repeat the previous year’s 3-1 win until Daniel Sturridge changed the game on the stroke of half-time. Sturridge will be missing against the unbeaten Villa because of injury suffered with England but that leaves centre stage clear for Mario Balotelli on his home debut. Adam Lallana and Lazar Markovic are also pressing for inclusion as Liverpool look to build on their impressive dismantling of Spurs last time out.Andy Hunter"
1359,Chelsea,Swansea City,Fri 12 Sep 2014 19.11 BST,2014-15,"Something has to give. The only teams with perfect Premier League records go head to head at Stamford Bridge and points will be shed for the first time. Chelsea may still prefer to rest Diego Costa, the division's player of the month, with one eye on a suspect hamstring and the other on Wednesday's visit of Schalke. The Welsh club, under the elite's manager of the month, have not won a league game in this corner of south-west London since 1925, though they will be sustained by the League Cup semi-final first leg win here in 2013. Such is their current confidence, they will be convinced they are capable of a repeat. Dominic Fifield"
1360,Southampton,Newcastle United,Fri 12 Sep 2014 17.48 BST,2014-15,Southampton face winless Newcastle who let slip a commanding lead against Crystal Palace in the final seconds at St James' Park two weeks ago. Conversely Ronald Koeman's Saints picked up their first win of the campaign and will look to build further on an emphatic away win against West Ham. Morgan Schneiderlin scored twice and Koeman will definitely be looking for more of the same from the Frenchman. Graham Searles
1361,Arsenal,Manchester City,Fri 12 Sep 2014 16.47 BST,2014-15,"Arsenal coasted to victory in the Community Shield against City but this promises to be an altogether more intense occasion. For both clubs it is the precursor to big midweek Champions League ties in Germany while for City, the kicker at the end of the week is provided by the visit of Chelsea. Victory in the early kick-off would represent a tonic, particularly, one feels, for Arsenal, whose record against top-four finishers in the last few seasons has been poor. David Hytner"
1362,Sunderland,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 12 Sep 2014 16.07 BST,2014-15,"As a former player and assistant manager at White Hart Lane, Gus Poyet would enjoy overcoming his old club on an afternoon when his defensive midfielder Lee Cattermole will want to show why he merits an England call-up. Italy's Emmanuel Giaccherini is similarly anxious to emphasise that he is no longer Sunderland's forgotten man but Mauricio Pochettino will look to outwit a fellow South American manager en route to seeing his Tottenham team atone for their 3-0 home defeat to Liverpool a fortnight ago. Louise Taylor"
1363,Hull City,West Ham United,Fri 12 Sep 2014 15.40 BST,2014-15,"Hull City have an improved attacking lineup after signing Hatem Ben Arfa, who starts, on loan and Abel Hernández for a club record fee of £10 million. Steve Bruce will be looking to repeat his side's 1-0 home victory last season over West Ham who also start a new loan signing in Alex Song. Sam Allardyce will want Song to recreate the performances that led Barcelona to sign him from Arsenal in 2012. Graham Searles"
1364,Crystal Palace,Burnley,Fri 12 Sep 2014 15.07 BST,2014-15,"After the uncertainty caused by Tony Pulis's departure, Crystal Palace finally have some stability now that Neil Warnock has been appointed as their manager for the second time. Warnock, who will need no introduction to the Selhurst Park crowd, will hope that Palace have a spring in their step after their dramatic draw against Newcastle United, but they are still seeking their first win of the season. However Burnley, who secured a creditable draw against Manchester United in their last match, will not roll over. Jacob Steinberg"
1365,West Ham United,Southampton,Fri 29 Aug 2014 19.26 BST,2014-15,"For Sam Allardyce the international break cannot come soon enough – West Ham have five players out injured and another, Diafra Sakho, doubtful with a back problem. Several of them are expected to return when the top flight reconvenes on 13 September but for now the West Ham manager will have to make the best of what he has against Southampton. The visitors are missing Jay Rodriguez but most of the rest of their new-look squad are available. Rich Flower"
1366,Queens Park Rangers,Sunderland,Fri 29 Aug 2014 19.11 BST,2014-15,"QPR may find themselves short of wing-backs for their 3-5-2 as Danny Simpson and Armand Traoré are thought to be negotiating moves away from Loftus Road and Jack Robinson, recently signed from Liverpool, has been loaned to Huddersfield. Harry Redknapp could have Charlie Austin available again after a thigh injury but his struggling side will be facing a fully fit Sunderland squad. Rich Flower"
1367,Swansea City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 29 Aug 2014 18.26 BST,2014-15,"Swansea are expected to field their new recruit, Federico Fernández, from the outset and he will be tasked with containing West Bromwich Albion’s record signing, Brown Ideye, although he will be spared having to face Georgios Samaras as well – the Greece striker is still lacking match fitness. Albion will be hoping to improve on their record of four defeats in six Premier League games against Swansea. Rich Flower"
1368,Manchester City,Stoke City,Fri 29 Aug 2014 18.07 BST,2014-15,"Manchester City have denied rumours of an injury in training to Sergio Agüero but the striker will probably not be in the starting lineup. Even if Agüero is not fully fit, Manuel Pellegrini can still call upon Stevan Jovetic, scorer of two goals against Liverpool on Monday, and Edin Dzeko. Stoke also have strength in depth and Victor Moses, signed by Mark Hughes on loan from Chelsea this week, is expected to be on the bench. Rich Flower"
1369,Leicester City,Arsenal,Fri 29 Aug 2014 17.21 BST,2014-15,"A game that evokes memories of Dennis Bergkamp’s wonderful hat-trick in the thrilling 3-3 draw under the floodlights at Filbert Street back in 1997. How Arsène Wenger must wish that he could call on the Dutchman now. With Olivier Giroud facing a long period out, Wenger’s belief that Arsenal are not light up front will come under scrutiny on an afternoon when Esteban Cambiasso could make his debut for Leicester. The Foxes have not beaten Arsenal in the Premier League since 1994. Stuart James"
1370,Burnley,Manchester United,Fri 29 Aug 2014 17.02 BST,2014-15,"The order of the day for Manchester United is simple: win. After dropping five of the first six points on offer and being beaten 4-0 by MK Dons in the Capital One Cup, the Louis van Gaal’s team are yet enjoy to victory. Three points at Turf Moor would correct this and help rebuild “smashed” confidence yet Burnley have happy memories of winning the corresponding match the last time they were in the Premier League. If Ángel di María features, the tight compact ground will provide a memorable backdrop to the debut of British football’s most expensive player. Jamie Jackson"
1371,Aston Villa,Hull City,Fri 29 Aug 2014 16.17 BST,2014-15,"After picking up four points from their opening two games, it has been a few days to forget for Aston Villa and Hull. Villa were defeated by lower-league opponents yet again, when they lost to Leyton Orient in the Capital One Cup, while Hull’s European campaign came to an abrupt end after losing on away goals. Villa badly need some firepower, after registering only one shot on goal in the league so far. As for Hull, Michael Dawson, newly signed from Tottenham, should make his debut. Stuart James"
1372,Everton,Chelsea,Fri 29 Aug 2014 15.55 BST,2014-15,"Roberto Martínez claimed his first league win as Everton manager against Chelsea, the victory arriving in the second home game of last season following three draws. After two draws so far, both a consequence of conceding late goals, he will be hoping for a repeat with the ex-Chelsea strikers Romelu Lukaku and Samuel Eto’o in his ranks but this is a far more potent and creative José Mourinho side than the one that arrived at Goodison Park for Eto’o’s debut 12 months ago. Andy Hunter"
1373,Tottenham Hotspur,Liverpool,Fri 29 Aug 2014 14.28 BST,2014-15,"This fixture demonstrated the gulf between Tottenham Hotspur, under André Villas-Boas and Tim Sherwood, and those in the top four last season. Liverpool ran riot at White Hart Lane with Luis Suárez irrepressible, and then blitzed them in the return to the tune of a 9-0 aggregate scoreline. Mauricio Pochettino’s Spurs, with a perfect record to date under the Argentinian, will provide a sterner test and, if they click into their upbeat rhythm, could leave Liverpool’s start to the campaign feeling stodgy. The visitors, with Mario Balotelli in their ranks, will seek to reimpose their quality after losing at Manchester City on Monday. Dominic Fifield"
1374,Newcastle United,Crystal Palace,Fri 29 Aug 2014 12.32 BST,2014-15,"Neil Warnock returns to the technical area as Crystal Palace manager for a game Alan Pardew could really do with winning if Newcastle fans are to continue to offer him the benefit of the doubt. Much improved in midfield – where all eyes will be on Jack Colback in the wake of his England call-up – the home side still look lightweight in attack and await their first league goal of the season. Meanwhile Pardew, once a Palace midfielder, has promised to refrain from engagement in touchline disputes with his feisty counterpart. Louise Taylor"
1375,Sunderland,Manchester United,Fri 22 Aug 2014 22.29 BST,2014-15,"As Louis van Gaal seeks his first league win with Manchester United, Sunderland aim to inflict further misery on the club. Not content with defeating David Moyes’s side in last season’s Capital One Cup semi-final, Gus Poyet’s players upset Ryan Giggs’s caretakership with a springtime league win at Old Trafford. Even so, Vito Mannone, the home goalkeeper, admits he will be “more happy” if his one time Arsenal team-mate Robin van Persie does not start in attack for the visitors. Louise Taylor"
1376,Aston Villa,Newcastle United,Fri 22 Aug 2014 19.38 BST,2014-15,"For Aston Villa this fixture represents an opportunity to win the opening two matches of a season for the first time since 1999. Buoyed by last Saturday’s 1-0 win at Stoke, Villa are also boosted by the availability of Carlos Sánchez and Joe Cole, both of whom could make debuts. Newcastle, however, are unbeaten in six games against Villa and did the double over them last season. Siem de Jong is set to make his first appearance and Facundo Ferreyra, on loan from Shakhtar Donetsk, could also feature. Stuart James"
1377,Chelsea,Leicester City,Fri 22 Aug 2014 18.44 BST,2014-15,"José Mourinho may have said it is “difficult” playing newly promoted sides early in the season but his team had few problems overcoming Burnley at Turf Moor on Monday night. Nigel Pearson will be hoping that his Leicester side – beaten only four times away from home in the league last season – can present more of a challenge at Stamford Bridge this afternoon, otherwise it could be another easy three points for Chelsea. Rich Flower"
1378,Swansea City,Burnley,Fri 22 Aug 2014 18.36 BST,2014-15,Swansea City will be looking to maintain their winning streak against Burnley after defeating Manchester United. Swansea’s confidence is reflected by their choice to stick with last week’s winning line-up. Burnley also name an unchanged line-up in their search for their first points of the season. New Swansea signing Federico Fernández is still waiting for international clearance and is unlikely to make his debut. Graham Searles
1379,Southampton,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 22 Aug 2014 17.48 BST,2014-15,"West Bromwich Albion’s record signing, Brown Ideye, may make his debut in a refreshed strike force that will look to improve on the club’s poor goal tally last season. Georgios Samaras, however, will not be available in time for kick-off. Ronald Koeman, who is also dealing with a much changed forward lineup, will want Southampton to build on their solid but fruitless opening display against Liverpool. Graham Searles"
1380,Manchester City,Liverpool,Fri 22 Aug 2014 17.14 BST,2014-15,"This is only the second match of the season yet there is the potential double reward of a title rival being defeated plus crucial momentum achieved. As the deal for Mario Balotelli was not done in time for the forward to be available for Liverpool, Manchester City must surely fancy their chances of finishing Monday evening with all three points, especially as only Alvaro Negredo and Eliaquim Mangala are unavailable to Manuel Pellegrini. Jamie Jackson"
1381,Tottenham Hotspur,Queens Park Rangers,Fri 22 Aug 2014 17.06 BST,2014-15,"Harry Redknapp makes his first return to White Hart Lane, where he hoisted Tottenham Hotspur from the relegation zone to regular Champions League contenders during almost four years in north London, since his acrimonious divorce from Daniel Levy. His former player Danny Rose has led the calls for the 67-year-old to be granted “a good reception”, though QPR will hope Spurs are sluggish after their Europa League qualifying exploits in Cyprus on Thursday. It is 20 years since Rangers last triumphed across the capital at Spurs. Their new signings, Mauricio Isla and Leroy Fer, should feature. Dominic Fifield"
1382,Everton,Arsenal,Fri 22 Aug 2014 16.43 BST,2014-15,"Arsène Wenger has his World Cup winners back for the visit to Goodison Park and the availability of Mesut Özil, Per Mertesacker and Lukas Podolski is timely following a taxing Champions League trip to Istanbul in midweek and the loss of Mikel Arteta to an ankle injury. Arsenal were outplayed and Wenger outthought in a 3-0 defeat at Everton in April, with Romelu Lukaku starring for Roberto Martínez’s side. Goodison will be keen for a repeat from the £28m striker after a subdued opening game at Leicester City. Andy Hunter"
1383,Hull City,Stoke City,Fri 22 Aug 2014 16.02 BST,2014-15,"The reality of competing on two fronts may hit home for Steve Bruce on Sunday. The Hull manager is expected to make changes to the side that lost 1-0 at Lokeren on Thursday but with Yannick Sagbo banned and Robert Snodgrass injured, he may be stretching his already small squad to the limit. Stoke, conversely, are fully rested and almost no injury concerns – it could be a good day at the KC Stadium for Mark Hughes. Rich Flower"
1384,Crystal Palace,West Ham United,Fri 22 Aug 2014 13.46 BST,2014-15,"Crystal Palace will be relieved to get back on the pitch after another week of turmoil. They have not been able to find a replacement for Tony Pulis, their sporting director has left, and Keith Millen will be in caretaker charge again. Yet this is a good opportunity for Palace to secure their first win. They were solid at Selhurst Park last season and did the double over West Ham, who are under pressure after last week’s defeat to Tottenham. Sam Allardyce needs a result. Jacob Steinberg"
1385,West Bromwich Albion,Sunderland,Fri 15 Aug 2014 18.37 BST,2014-15,Both sides have opted for a revamp over the summer – West Bromwich Albion have made eight signings and allowed 13 players to leave while Sunderland have brought in six new faces and let 16 go. This match could provide an early indication of whether the changes will produce results at either club in the weeks to come. If they do not then both managers could easily find themselves battling relegation this season. Rich Flower
1386,Arsenal,Crystal Palace,Fri 15 Aug 2014 18.30 BST,2014-15,"Arsène Wenger will be pleased by Tony Pulis’s sudden departure from Crystal Palace as he prepares to break Arsenal’s bad opening day result streak of three losses and one draw in the past four years. Key in this could be the Chile striker Alexis Sánchez, making his first competitive appearance. Brede Hangeland, also on debut, faces the challenge of stopping the ex-Barcelona man. Graham Searles"
1387,Manchester United,Swansea City,Fri 15 Aug 2014 18.15 BST,2014-15,"Beset by injuries, Louis van Gaal could have done with another couple of weeks before his Premier League bow. Having only two fit, senior centre-backs puts a wrinkle in his 3-5-2 formation. At least the new captain, Wayne Rooney, is available to terrorise Swansea’s backline; shorn of the impressive Ben Davies and Chico, Garry Monk needs those remaining to shine straight away. Toby Moses"
1388,Liverpool,Southampton,Fri 15 Aug 2014 17.44 BST,2014-15,"Southampton were one of only two visiting teams to win at Anfield last season but will be unrecognisable for Ronald Koeman’s first Premier League game in charge. The goalscorer in that 1-0 win, Dejan Lovren, joined the summer exodus from St Mary’s to Liverpool and is the only former Saint likely to start against his old club with Adam Lallana suffering from a knee injury and Rickie Lambert, who has scored against all his ex-teams, set for the substitutes’ bench.

While Stoke supporters are looking forward to the prospect of former Barcelona prodigy Bojan Krkic making his debut, the Villa visitors have Philippe Senderos and an ageing Joe Cole.

1392,Newcastle United,Manchester City,Fri 15 Aug 2014 16.47 BST,2014-15,"Liam Sweeney and John Alder, who lost their lives on MH17, will be remembered as City’s title defence begins. Sweeney and Alder were flying to New Zealand to follow Newcastle’s summer tour and the pre kick-off atmosphere is likely to be rather more reflective than usual. Bolstered by some exciting new signings including Remy Cabella, Alan Pardew should escape the abuse which trapped him in his dugout at the end of last season but could do with choreographing Newcastle’s first win over City since 2005.

1393,West Ham United,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 15 Aug 2014 16.28 BST,2014-15,"West Ham beat Tottenham Hotspur three times last season and Mauricio Pochettino, the ninth manager Daniel Levy has appointed, will be desperate to stop them extending that run. Tottenham are likely to play on the unrest at Upton Park, where support for Sam Allardyce is at an all-time low. West Ham will be without the injured Andy Carroll, out with torn ankle ligaments until November, but have been boosted by the signing of Diafra Sakho from Metz. Jacob Steinberg"

That was the latter's last game in charge, the fifth of seven matches lost in succession. Yet Tony Pulis has steered the Eagles to a remarkable 11th place with the turmoil transferred to Craven Cottage. The hosts, now on their third manager of term, bid farewell to the top flight after 13 seasons with a summer of change ahead: the hope is their talented youngsters from an excellent academy are given opportunities on the final day to promise of an immediate return.

For the first time this campaign the Chilean has everyone fit so expect his first-choice team to be assembled at the Etihad and, if Yaya Touré, David Silva, Sergio Agüero and company score early, this could turn into a party that will still be going on Monday morning.

Will Ryan Giggs round off his brief reign with a victory? Will young James Wilson produce a display as superb as his midweek debut? If the visitors win at St Mary's and Tottenham Hostpur lose to Aston Villa, how will they react to qualifying for the Europa League? Paul Doyle"

In October, Gus Poyet presided over his first game as Sunderland manager at Swansea . It was a 4-0 defeat and left his new team with one point from eight games. Seven months on Poyet has choreographed a miraculous escape from relegation and the Stadium of Light is preparing to party. With Garry Monk newly confirmed as Swansea's manager the visitors should be in similarly light-hearted mood. Expect some good passing and maybe a goal or two from Wilfried Bony or Connor Wickham.

1402,Cardiff City,Chelsea,Fri 9 May 2014 16.40 BST,2013-14,"Not the game either set of fans hoped it would be. In an ideal world Chelsea would be going for the title and Cardiff in with a fighting chance of survival but the season has not panned out as planned. Chelsea, for whom Ashley Cole could make his last appearance, will wonder how different things might have been with a prolific striker. As for Cardiff, it took 51 years to return to the top flight and it was not exactly worth the wait. Stuart James"

Arsenal 1989, Istanbul 2005 and Crystanbul – as Monday's three-goal collapse at Selhurst Park has become known – all ensure Anfield will not concede the title to Manchester City unless or until it is a mathematical certainty. To be saying that before the final game of the season underlines what a campaign this has been under Brendan Rodgers. First, however, Liverpool must pick themselves off the floor after Crystal Palace to capitalise on Alan Pardew's problems at Newcastle United. Andy Hunter"
1405,Chelsea,Norwich City,Fri 2 May 2014 18.52 BST,2013-14,"Chelsea know their faint title hopes will effectively be extinguished if they fail to beat Neil Adams's struggling side, while the visitors might fear their stay in the division will go the same way if they do not prevail. ""They are playing for their lives,"" said Mourinho of Norwich. ""They have two games to decide whether they will be playing at Chelsea, Arsenal, United next season, or midweek games in the Championship."" He saw his own team lose at home to Sunderland, then bottom of the division, in his last home league match so his players have been warned. Dominic Fifield"
1406,West Ham,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 2 May 2014 17.55 BST,2013-14,"The season is ending curiously for both these clubs. Tottenham will finish outside the top four, but should still reach the Europa League and cannot have expected more after sacking André Villas-Boas in December and replacing him with a relative novice. Four consecutive defeats have led West Ham fans to call for Sam Allardyce to go, but they were happy enough after four wins in a row in February. Paul Chronnell"
1407,Arsenal,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 2 May 2014 17.19 BST,2013-14,"Arsène Wenger says the heat, as usual, will be on Arsenal until the very last but at least this season it could be because they have a shot at silverware in the FA Cup final. They can sew up Champions League qualification again here and it remains a creditable achievement, even if it has become the minimum requirement. West Brom hope to be safe from relegation by Sunday evening. David Hytner"
1408,Crystal Palace,Liverpool,Fri 2 May 2014 16.54 BST,2013-14,"Liverpool may go into Monday's fixture at Selhurst Park in third place but, regardless, must triumph in south London if they are realistically to have any chance of securing a first league title in 24 years. There can be no lingering fallout from the damaging defeat to Chelsea, and Crystal Palace, safe in mid-table, would appear timely opposition. Yet Liverpool have not won on their last four visits to Palace, a sequence stretching back to December 1997, and the hosts will seek to end their own home campaign on a high. An awkward evening awaits. Dominic Fifield "
1409,Stoke City,Fulham,Fri 2 May 2014 16.21 BST,2013-14,"Felix Magath has probably had a long week thinking about the moment last Saturday when his side were 2-0 up against Hull with 15 minutes remaining and seemingly heading out of the relegation zone. Their failure to hold on to that lead means that they now depend on other results as well as their own, but winning on Saturday could put them back in control of their own destiny. Paul Chronnell"
1410,Everton,Manchester City,Fri 2 May 2014 15.30 BST,2013-14,"Manuel Pellegrini's team have been given a second chance to show their championship credentials on Merseyside, three weeks after falling short at Liverpool, and cannot afford to waste it against an Everton side with outside hopes of Champions League qualification. Goodison Park has brought City little reward for a decade and has witnessed only two home league defeats this season, although injuries and the ineligibility of Gareth Barry against his parent club limits Roberto Martínez's options. With Aston Villa and West Ham to follow at home, this promises to be the biggest obstacle to a second title in three seasons for City. Andy Hunter"
1411,Newcastle United,Cardiff City,Fri 2 May 2014 15.06 BST,2013-14,"""P45 Due"" screamed an Evening Chronicle front page headline aimed at Alan Pardew in the wake of Monday night's 3-0 collapse at Arsenal. It was Newcastle's sixth straight defeat and has left Pardew extremely vulnerable. To exacerbate his woes, the home fans are planning a mass protest walkout in the 69th minute – the club last won a trophy, the Fairs Cup, in 1969 – of what is also a very big game for Cardiff City. If relegation is to be averted, Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's side must win. Louise Taylor"
1412,Swansea,Southampton,Fri 2 May 2014 14.33 BST,2013-14,"Southampton go into their final two games of an excellent season knowing their position of eighth cannot change and, with the shackles off, Mauricio Pochettino is set to hand a start to Sam Gallagher, the 18-year-old forward. Swansea confirmed their top-flight status with the 4-1 thumping of Aston Villa, a result which did the future of the interim manager Garry Monk no harm at all. Paul Chronnell"
1413,Aston Villa,Hull City,Fri 2 May 2014 13.34 BST,2013-14,"It is possible that the 35 points Aston Villa have so far accrued will be sufficient to extend their 26-year top-flight existence. However, with their final two fixtures away at Manchester City and then Tottenham, this is their best chance to make sure. Hull, only two points better off than their hosts, also need another victory before they can turn their thoughts to Wembley. Paul Chronnell"
1414,Manchester United,Sunderland,Fri 2 May 2014 12.49 BST,2013-14,"The fascination with the four-match Ryan Giggs managerial era is how the team fares each time he sends it out. For the visit of a resurgent Sunderland the outgoing champions make their penultimate home appearance of a bumpy campaign hoping to make it two wins from two under the Welshman. The £27.5m Marouane Fellaini will be hoping to return to the squad, having missed out against Norwich City last week. Jamie Jackson"
1415,Stoke City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 25 Apr 2014 18.49 BST,2013-14,"Despite taking seven points from their past three games, Tottenham are highly unlikely to have a chance of securing fourth place. A victory for Stoke will give them a first of five successive Premier League home wins, a record that the club and the manager, Mark Hughes, wholly deserve. A win will also virtually guarantee their place in the top 10 to cap a fine first season for the Welshman. Charlotte Trundley"
1416,Liverpool,Chelsea,Fri 25 Apr 2014 18.10 BST,2013-14,"Victory for Liverpool for the 12th successive league game would surely mean that their 24-year wait for the league title is over, but Brendan Rodgers knows that even Chelsea's supposed 'second XI' is a formidable barrier to that aim. José Mourinho will still select 11 players who are the envy of most of the Premier League, and it goes without saying he won't simply give up the title race. Paul Chronnell"
1417,Manchester United,Norwich City,Fri 25 Apr 2014 17.17 BST,2013-14,"Ryan Giggs's first of four outings as Manchester United's interim manager promises to be an emotional affair with the only anti-climax occurring if Norwich City were to win. The Welshman is aware of the danger the division's 17th-placed team present – ""They're fighting for their lives,"" he says – so expect a full-blooded assault on the visitors from first whistle to last before an Old Trafford crowd desperate for something to cheer. Jamie Jackson"
1418,Southampton,Everton,Fri 25 Apr 2014 16.46 BST,2013-14,"Everton's Champions League dream remains alive after last week's victory over Manchester United. They are a point behind fourth-placed Arsenal but they cannot afford a slip-up against Southampton, who will be encouraged by the news that Roberto Martinez's side will be without their first-choice centre-backs, Sylvain Distin and Phil Jagielka, through injury; Rickie Lambert will hope to capitalise on any unfamiliarity between Antolín Alcaraz and John Stones. However Southampton have injury problems of their own and are without a victory in their past three matches. Jacob Steinberg"
1419,Crystal Palace,Manchester City,Fri 25 Apr 2014 16.19 BST,2013-14,"This has taken on the appearance of an awkward hurdle in Manchester City's pursuit of the Premier League title. Their hosts have won five top-flight games in succession for the first time in 22 years, their safety assured and the manager, Tony Pulis, now urging his team on to a top-half finish. City, without David Silva and Jesús Navas, will be grateful for Yaya Touré's potential return in midfield as they seek to prolong the title race. Come kick-off, when the result at Anfield will be known, they will be better placed to judge their own challenge. Ship points in south London and it will feel forlorn regardless. Dominic Fifield"
1420,Fulham,Hull City,Fri 25 Apr 2014 16.02 BST,2013-14,"Despite last Saturday's untimely defeat at Tottenham, Fulham's relegation escape plan will stay on track if they can triumph in what looks like an eminently winnable home game. Hull are not safe yet but are limping to the line even with FA Cup final places to play for. Felix Magath will hope Scott Parker shakes off a hip problem as his side aim to climb out of the bottom three. Paul Chronnell"
1421,Arsenal,Newcastle United,Fri 25 Apr 2014 15.13 BST,2013-14,"Arsenal could be playing catch-up with Everton yet again by Monday evening in their pursuit of a top-four finish, though, on paper, a home collision with Newcastle is as appealing a fixture as any to fuel a rousing run-in. Alan Pardew's side have been ensconced in mid-table safety for so long that all momentum has been drained. They arrive in the capital with a squad depleted by injury and having lost their last five games, and 13 of 18 in all competitions since the end of December. Arsène Wenger will be licking his lips at the prospect of the match ahead. Dominic Fifield"
1422,Swansea City,Aston Villa,Fri 25 Apr 2014 14.36 BST,2013-14,"Still without a win in five games, Villa's top-10 position just over a month ago is a distant memory. Only two wins better than bottom-placed Sunderland and without an away triumph since New Year's Day, Paul Lambert's team face a tough job against a Swansea side boosted by last Saturday's win at Newcastle. Their interim manager, Garry Monk, needs consistency in these final matches if he is to have any chance of the permanent position. Charlotte Trundley"
1423,West Bromwich Albion,West Ham United,Fri 25 Apr 2014 14.22 BST,2013-14,"Their first meeting this season was memorable, not for the quality of football but for Nicolas Anelka's controversial quenelle gesture. West Brom are looking pretty desperate, teetering on the edge of the drop zone, and their manager, Pepe Mel, has pinpointed this game as the one where three points must be taken. As West Ham are without a win in three games, it does seem the moment for Albion to ease their relegation fears. Charlotte Trundley"
1424,Sunderland,Cardiff City,Fri 25 Apr 2014 13.13 BST,2013-14,"A high noon shootout and the stakes can rarely have been greater in a genuine relegation six pointer. Expect to see Sunderland fans unfurling ""Miracles Do Happen Gus"" banners. Not so long ago Gus Poyet claimed only ""a miracle"" would save his side but a point at Manchester City and all three at Chelsea have revived Wearside optimism. No matter; Cardiff - for whom Fraizer Campbell would doubtless relish scoring against his old club -will be heartened by Sunderland's habit of beating the better teams while stumbling against the rest. Louise Taylor"
1425,Newcastle United,Swansea City,Fri 18 Apr 2014 19.23 BST,2013-14,"Two tense dressing rooms, two managers contemplating uncertain futures. If the St James' Park crowd would probably not forgive Alan Pardew for a fifth straight defeat, Swansea seem to have forgotten that their mantra is supposed to be all about passing to each other rather than infighting. If Garry Monk's side can retain possession for prolonged periods Newcastle fans are likely to be turn edgy so Pardew may persist with a back five and must pray the returning France striker Loïc Rémy can alter the narrative. Louise Taylor"
1426,Manchester City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 18 Apr 2014 19.18 BST,2013-14,"By the time West Bromwich Albion arrive at the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening, Manchester City will hope that both Sunderland and Norwich City have done them a big favour by defeating their title rivals, Chelsea and Liverpool. This is how desperate and how far Manuel Pellegrini's band of multi-millionaires have fallen: looking to the Premier League's bottom and 17th-placed teams to get them back in the race following the dismal draw with Sunderland on Wednesday. Jamie Jackson"
1427,Cardiff City,Stoke City,Fri 18 Apr 2014 19.11 BST,2013-14,"Given that their remaining home game is on the final day against Chelsea, this match has the feel of the last-chance saloon for Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and his side if they are to avoid an instant return to the Championship. Stoke have won four of their past five league games to climb into the top half of the table, a lofty position that Mark Hughes will be keen for his team to remain in. Paul Chronnell"
1428,Aston Villa,Southampton,Fri 18 Apr 2014 19.04 BST,2013-14,"Aston Villa badly need to end a damaging week with the victory that would put their relegation fears to bed. The club's decision to suspend Ian Culverhouse, the assistant manager, and Gary Karsa, the head of football operations, on the back of a fourth successive defeat has left them in a state of turmoil. It is 13 years since Villa lost five league games on the spin. The visitors are also struggling, having lost three of their last four. Something has to give. Stuart James"
1429,Chelsea,Sunderland,Fri 18 Apr 2014 18.58 BST,2013-14,"Manchester City's midweek toils against the division's bottom club should serve as a warning to Chelsea, who aspire to reclaim leadership of the division for one night at least with an onerous fixture list ahead. José Mourinho will balance his selection with the Champions League semi-finals to come and next weekend's trip to Liverpool stretching his squad's resources. Sunderland must seek to repeat their resounding 3-0 success of November 2010 in these parts, but they did eliminate a strong Chelsea team from the League Cup in December. Gus Poyet is back in familiar territory. He will be craving an unfamiliar result. Dominic Fifield"
1430,Hull City,Arsenal,Fri 18 Apr 2014 16.46 BST,2013-14,"After last weekend's Wembley exertions, this game is now an FA Cup final rehearsal, although both sides have some unfinished business to attend to before they can start thinking about 17 May. Hull need another win to kill off any lingering relegation fears while Arsène Wenger, having seen fourth place rapidly reclaimed from Everton in midweek, will very much want to stay there. Paul Chronnell"
1431,Everton,Manchester United,Fri 18 Apr 2014 16.13 BST,2013-14,David Moyes brings a team he needs to rebuild to the home of one he built over 11 years and where he will hope to get a decent reception to recognise his galvanising of a club who in the 90s twice went to the final day before ensuring Premier League status. Everton are still smarting from the midweek home loss to Palace and looking for a first double over United since 1969-70. Mark Tallentire
1432,Tottenham Hotspur,Fulham,Fri 18 Apr 2014 15.40 BST,2013-14,"Fulham won this fixture last season and what they would not give for the same again. The scrutiny that has been placed on the run-in has long since reached head-wrecking levels and, realistically, Fulham know that they need to win at home to Hull and Crystal Palace. But something here, against a team that seemingly cannot start matches properly, would be a delicious tonic in the battle to prolong their 13-year association with the Premier League. David Hytner"
1433,Norwich City,Liverpool,Fri 18 Apr 2014 14.46 BST,2013-14,"This match is the calm between the storms for Liverpool coming as it does after the win against Manchester City and before the visit of Chelsea, yet it is equally important for Brendan Rodgers' title-chasing side. Luis Suárez will relish the occasion given he has scored 11 times in his past four games against Norwich, who will be managed at home for the first time by Neil Adams. Sachin Nakrani"
1434,West Ham United,Crystal Palace,Fri 18 Apr 2014 14.21 BST,2013-14,"Tony Pulis and Sam Allardyce are often depicted as being from the same mould but while the West Ham manager has been booed by his own fans this season because of a lack of sparkling football, Pulis is basking in acclaim thanks to a run of four straight wins that has guaranteed Palace's survival and sees Jason Puncheon mounting a late push for an England World Cup call-up. West Ham will have their work cut out to send their fans home happy. Paul Doyle"
1435,Swansea City,Chelsea,Fri 11 Apr 2014 17.51 BST,2013-14,By the time Chelsea kick-off in south Wales on Sunday they will have a greater understanding of the task at hand if they are to pip Liverpool and Manchester City to the title. A draw in the earlier game at Anfield would suit José Mourinho's team but a win for City would allow Chelsea to go top with three points against a Swansea side who are still fighting to confirm their top-flight status. Alan Smith
1436,Crystal Palace,Aston Villa,Fri 11 Apr 2014 17.42 BST,2013-14,"After two successive 3-0 victories, Crystal Palace could virtually assure their Premier League status by completing the double over Villa. Things are rarely that simple at Selhurst Park, however, and Tony Pulis will be wary of underestimating opponents lacking their leading scorer Christian Benteke but who have picked up more points away from home than any side in the bottom half. Ed Aarons"
1437,Hull City,Sheffield United,Fri 11 Apr 2014 17.11 BST,2013-14,"Hull have never been to the FA Cup final and nor has any side from the third tier, which is where Sheffield United currently find themselves. Nigel Clough's side will start as underdogs but having tamed Aston Villa already in this Cup run they will not be daunted by taking on Steve Bruce's team who will be without Shane Long and Nikica Jelavic, the strikers who helped them secured their Premier League survival. Paul Doyle"
1438,Liverpool,Manchester City,Fri 11 Apr 2014 17.03 BST,2013-14,"Five more wins will see Liverpool crowned champions of England for the 19th time and for the first time since 1990. Easy to write, harder to accomplish. The visit of Manchester City presents arguably the toughest assignment left for Brendan Rodgers' side, although Chelsea also await, and victory at a seething Anfield would leave Manuel Pellegrini's side requiring a slip-up. City, however, with Sergio Agüero fit again, can wrestle control of the title should they inflict a first home defeat on Liverpool since September. Andy Hunter"
1439,Southampton,Cardiff City,Fri 11 Apr 2014 16.40 BST,2013-14,"Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said Cardiff needed to beat Crystal Palace last week to stand a chance of staying up but this trip to the south coast really must be their final chance of staging an unlikely fight to avoid the drop. Their awful away form, with a solitary win on the road, coupled with Southampton's attacking strength, makes a win seem unlikely even if Mauricio Pochettino's team are comfortably ensconced in eighth. Alan Smith"
1440,Sunderland,Everton,Fri 11 Apr 2014 16.31 BST,2013-14,"Gus Poyet and Roberto Martínez were once midfield team-mates at Real Zaragoza. Managerially their respective philosophies have much in common but, right now, their careers are on divergent trajectories. While Everton arrive with a Champions League place almost within touching distance, Poyet concedes it will ""take a miracle"" to save Sunderland from the Championship. As Martínez seeks revenge for the Wearsiders's unexpected 1-0 Boxing Day win at Goodison Park his old friend simply prays for a first league victory since February 1. Louise Taylor"
1441,West Bromwich Albion,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 11 Apr 2014 16.25 BST,2013-14,"West Brom have still not won at home under Pepe Mel but it should also be noted that since he took over in January Manchester United are the only team to have won at the Hawthorns, with Everton, Liverpool and Chelsea managing only draws. Five points above the relegation zone, a first home win over an unpredictable Tottenham would go a long way to ensuring their safety. Alan Smith "
1442,Wigan Athletic,Arsenal,Fri 11 Apr 2014 15.04 BST,2013-14,"There ought to be only one outcome when a top Premier League club meets Championship opposition at Wembley, particularly when the former is on a mission to end a nine-year trophy drought. But this is Arsenal and, as previous mishaps have proved, anything can happen. Anxiety stalks the club and Arsène Wenger's future remains on edge. Defeat to Wigan, the FA Cup holders, who beat Manchester City in the quarter-finals, could conceivably tip him over it. David Hytner"
1443,Stoke City,Newcastle United,Fri 11 Apr 2014 14.12 BST,2013-14,"Stoke have the league's best home record outside of the top five with two defeats (to Norwich and Liverpool), so when you consider Newcastle are haemorrhaging goals - conceding 11 without scoring in their past three outings - it would be a shock to see Mark Hughes' side slip to a third loss at the Britannia. Already closing in on their best Premier League finish, a win would move Stoke to within three points of Alan Pardew's troubled team. Alan Smith"
1444,Fulham,Norwich City,Fri 11 Apr 2014 13.42 BST,2013-14,"Who could have predicted at the start of the season that with five games remaining Felix Magath and Neil Adams would be in charge of Fulham and Norwich respectively? Yet here they are, preparing for a crucial game in the relegation struggle. Fulham, five points behind Norwich, won at Aston Villa last week and Darren Bent is available again. Adams insists his first match in charge since Chris Hughton's departure ""is not a decider"", but with Norwich's horrendous run-in, a defeat could be devastating. James Riach"
1445,Newcastle United,Manchester United,Fri 4 Apr 2014 22.31 BST,2013-14,"There was a time when this fixture involved two teams challenging for the title but on Saturday it is all about two managers under considerable scrutiny. While Alan Pardew – who admits he is struggling to motivate Newcastle's players – aims to compensate for last week's disappointing defeat at Southampton, David Moyes must balance the desire for points against potential European glory. With injuries depriving Pardew of several key individuals including Loïc Rémy, it will be interesting to see who he rests ahead of the Manchester United's decisive Champions League trip to Bayern Munich. Louise Taylor"
1446,Hull City,Swansea City,Fri 4 Apr 2014 18.19 BST,2013-14,"Swansea currently shade Hull on goal difference after beating Norwich last time out but with both hovering seven points above the danger zone, a win for either should be enough to secure safety.

Alan Smith"
1447,Tottenham Hotspur,Sunderland,Fri 4 Apr 2014 17.59 BST,2013-14,"Tottenham will be looking to recover from their devastating defeat to Liverpool against a Sunderland side who have struggled for goals recently. Tim Sherwood may call up the Brazilian Paulinho, who is desperate to stake his place in the Spurs team in preparation for the World Cup. Sunderland need to gather points quickly if they are to escape relegation but they do possess two games in hand. Karl Cryer"
1448,Chelsea,Stoke City,Fri 4 Apr 2014 17.34 BST,2013-14,"Chelsea cannot afford to dwell on either their midweek defeat in Paris, or for that matter their loss at Crystal Palace seven days ago. A team that looked strong for so long are suddenly faltering on all fronts but this match offers José Mourinho's men a chance to at least re-establish themselves in the Premier League. Worryingly for the home side, they face a Stoke side in good form. Sachin Nakrani"
1449,Manchester City,Southampton,Fri 4 Apr 2014 17.20 BST,2013-14,"City remain favourites to win the title but Southampton should provide more of a challenge than the average visitor to the Etihad this season. Still, three points here would put Manuel Pellegrini's team a point behind Liverpool with the top two set to collide next weekend. Playing in the early kick-off also gives City the opportunity to put a little more pressure on Liverpool and Chelsea with a 14th home win in 15 games. Alan Smith"
1450,Everton,Arsenal,Fri 4 Apr 2014 16.12 BST,2013-14,"Everton's fate is in their hands. Victory over Arsenal would move the Blues, who have won their past five league matches, a point behind them with a game in hand and a top-four finish would be within touching distance. Arsenal have faltered in big matches and will need to defend far better than they did in their previous away match, when they were trounced 6-0 by Chelsea. The scars from that defeat are yet to heal and Everton sense this is their time. Jacob Steinberg"
1451,Aston Villa,Fulham,Fri 4 Apr 2014 14.39 BST,2013-14,"Fulham have not won at Villa Park in the Premier League but if they are to cling on to any chance of remaining at the top table next season they need that to change against an Aston Villa minus Christian Benteke, who ruptured an achilles tendon in training on Thursday to ruin his World Cup plans. Paul Lambert's team are unpredictable but with safety almost assured, expect them to score despite being without their main marksman against the league's most porous defence. Alan Smith "
1452,West Ham United,Liverpool,Fri 4 Apr 2014 14.16 BST,2013-14,"Liverpool are yet to show signs of choking in their charge for the title but West Ham have the potential to make life awkward for them. Upton Park has been a graveyard for potential champions in the past and for Liverpool the fear must be that they will come unstuck at the hands of two of their former players, Andy Carroll and Stewart Downing. West Ham's defence, which has kept 13 clean sheets this season, poses another problem - but Brendan Rodgers has Luis Suárez. Jacob Steinberg"
1453,Norwich City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 4 Apr 2014 14.03 BST,2013-14,"Liverpool, Man United, Chelsea and Arsenal: Norwich's run-in is unenviable, making this and next week's trip to Fulham hugely important. Six points clear of the drop, a win over an increasingly desperate West Brom would put them in a good position. Norwich's home form is strong, with an unbeaten run stretching back to December, while West Brom's only win under Pepe Mel came on the road. Defeat for Albion will increase their fears. Alan Smith"
1454,Cardiff City,Crystal Palace,Fri 4 Apr 2014 13.46 BST,2013-14,"Not quite one to garner the attention of purists. Avoiding defeat is a must to keep Cardiff in with a chance of surviving but Crystal Palace will look to frustrate the hosts. And after last week's victory at home to Chelsea, Tony Pulis's team will be confident of a first win in 10 at Cardiff. They are not yet safe but a win would go a long way to securing their status and put Cardiff on the brink. Alan Smith"
1455,Fulham,Everton,Fri 28 Mar 2014 19.38 GMT,2013-14,"Fulham have seven matches to secure their Premier League survival and this threatens to be the hardest of the lot. Everton, with Ross Barkley and Romelu Lukaku seemingly revitalised after being rested by Roberto Martínez, appear to be gaining momentum and their pursuit of a Champions League spot means they will show no mercy to Felix Magath's men, who will likely have to produce their best performance of the season to avoid another defeat. Paul Doyle"
1456,Liverpool,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 28 Mar 2014 19.37 GMT,2013-14,"Momentum is behind Liverpool in the title race, with Brendan Rodgers's team unbeaten in the Premier Lleague in 2014 and taking 32 points from the last 36 available. The tension surrounding Sunderland's visit on Wednesday did not stop a seventh consecutive win and memories of December's 5-0 thrashing of Tottenham, Liverpool's biggest ever win at White Hart Lane, offer assurance. Spurs have taken one point from seven games against the current top four this season, conceding 23 goals, and have won once in their last 19 league visits to Anfield. Andy Hunter"

If Allardyce senses D-day approaching, Gus Poyet knows the feeling. With trips to Tottenham and Chelsea as well as a visit from Everton, April could be a cruel month for his Sunderland side. Victory against a Hammers team still not entirely safe themselves is surely imperative if relegation is to be avoided. Louise Taylor"
1458,Arsenal,Manchester City,Fri 28 Mar 2014 18.41 GMT,2013-14,"Arsenal fans are worried, and little wonder. Injuries have hit and the team's confidence is fragile while they encounter a City side fresh from their humbling of Manchester United and who remain as most people's title favourites. Arsène Wenger has them down as the side to beat. Arsenal's manager might have to temper his natural instinct to get on to the front foot – City bite. The visitors still have to go to Liverpool but they see this as a key staging post. David Hytner"
1459,Swansea City,Norwich City,Fri 28 Mar 2014 17.37 GMT,2013-14,"Coming off the back of last week's 2-0 win against Sunderland, another victory could see Norwich go 10 points clear of the relegation zone. Despite being without a win in their last six league games, Swansea will have been buoyed by the late point they earned at Arsenal on Tuesday. Norwich have never lost to Swansea in the Premier League but their run of five consecutive away defeats makes this one hard to call. Romily Preston-Ellis"
1460,Manchester United,Aston Villa,Fri 28 Mar 2014 16.58 GMT,2013-14,"David Moyes insists that the majority of Manchesterchester United fans are behind him despite the midweek derby defeat and hiring of a plane by some to fly over Old Trafford to protest. The Scot concedes he needs to win matches so who knows what might occur if United go down to Villa in what would be a seventh home league defeat. That would be a club record in the Premier League era, beating the mark set just on Tuesday evening when City beat Moyes's side 3-0 and Sir Alex Ferguson was abused by some supporters. This is how dire proceedings currently are at the defending champions. Jamie Jackson"
1461,West Bromwich Albion,Cardiff City,Fri 28 Mar 2014 16.54 GMT,2013-14,"Second-from-bottom Cardiff travel to The Hawthorns having lost their last away eight games and during which they have conceded at least two on seven occasions. West Bromwich are also in a dire state having won one in nine since Pepe Mel was appointed and are only three points clear of the relegation places having played a game more than Sunderland, who are placed 18th. Dan Cancian"
1462,Crystal Palace,Chelsea,Fri 28 Mar 2014 15.24 GMT,2013-14,"Victory in this derby may lack the resonance of last weekend's thrashing of Arsenal, but José Mourinho would still consider it critical. With Liverpool and Manchester City breathing down their necks, Chelsea can ill afford to slip up against a team without a win in five matches. Palace have scored only once, from a penalty, in that time, are without the injured Marouame Chamakh and have their eye on games with Cardiff and Aston Villa to come. Dominic Fifield"
1463,Southampton,Newcastle United,Fri 28 Mar 2014 15.22 GMT,2013-14,"It says a lot about Southampton and Newcastle that there is likely to be more attention on the referee than them. Andre Marriner will be hoping for a quiet afternoon after his blunder during Chelsea's win over Arsenal last week and will be glad that Alan Pardew, whose stadium ban is over, is not allowed on the touchline yet. Newcastle's manager is looking forward to giving his team-talk after three matches away. But both sides are safe in mid-table, so this is likely to be a low-pressure affair. Jacob Steinberg"
1464,Stoke City,Hull City,Fri 28 Mar 2014 15.19 GMT,2013-14,"With seven games to go, Stoke remain on track for a 10th-placed finish, their highest in the Premier League. Unsurprisingly, their home form has been the cornerstone of their relative success and with only two defeats at the Britannia all season, it would be quite surprising if Hull, who are similarly positioned in mid-table but could yet be dragged into a relegation fight, leave with a win. Alan Smith"
1465,Tottenham Hotspur,Southampton,Fri 21 Mar 2014 21.38 GMT,2013-14,"Spurs restored some pride in the second half against Benfica on Thursday but, after the defeat by Arsenal last weekend, their aim of securing a Champions League place lies in tatters. Injuries have not helped Tim Sherwood's case but he will be desperate to end a four-game winless run at home to Southampton, whose England players remain determined to earn World Cup call-ups. Alan Smith"
1466,Norwich City,Sunderland,Fri 21 Mar 2014 21.35 GMT,2013-14,"Another meeting of two sides struggling to keep their heads above water. Chris Hughton's future at Norwich is in a near constant state of doubt and if they are to maintain their Premier League status, they need results against the teams around them in the table. Sunderland, while third bottom, have games in hand due to their cup runs but that could yet prove their downfall as fixtures pile up. Alan Smith"
1467,Newcastle United,Crystal Palace,Fri 21 Mar 2014 21.34 GMT,2013-14,"The good news for struggling Palace is that Newcastle are without the injured Loïc Rémy for a seventh Premier League fixture this season. When the France striker, on loan from QPR, has been absent, Alan Pardew's team have lost five league games, drawn one and failed to score a single goal. ""Rémy's not our player but we struggle to score without him,"" acknowledged the one-time Palace midfielder who, because of a stadium ban, will watch the match on television at the training ground. Much may depend on if and when Hatem Ben Arfa is liberated from the home bench. Louise Taylor"
1468,Chelsea,Arsenal,Fri 21 Mar 2014 21.20 GMT,2013-14,"Arsène Wenger will take little satisfaction in overseeing his 1,000th match if the derby he has labelled Arsenal's ""game of the season"" is lost. This contest will go some way towards determining these clubs' respective title challenges, with the visitors aware that, if Wenger secures a first victory in 11 attempts over a team managed by José Mourinho, then a follow-up success at home to Swansea on Tuesday will send them top. Mourinho suggested this game was of no greater significance than last weekend's trip to Aston Villa, though that fooled no one. The loss of Willian and Ramires to suspension feels significant. Dominic Fifield"
1469,Aston Villa,Stoke City,Fri 21 Mar 2014 21.17 GMT,2013-14,"Aston Villa, buoyed by last week's surprise triumph over Chelsea, aim at Villa Park to make it three successive victories for the first time since October 2007. Hope can be taken from Stoke's poor away form – they have not won a league game outside the Potteries since August – and the fact that Charlie Adam and Jonathan Walters are suspended for the visitors and Stephen Ireland is ineligible. Anastasiia Tikhomirova"
1470,West Ham United,Manchester United,Fri 21 Mar 2014 20.58 GMT,2013-14,"The picture is looking much brighter for Manchester United now. Wednesday's victory over Olympiakos in the Champions League has lifted the gloom for David Moyes after last Sunday's humiliation at home to Liverpool, although United will have to be at their best at Upton Park, a ground where they have often come unstuck. The doubts will return if United lose to West Ham, who are not quite clear of the relegation battle just yet. West Ham have lost their past two matches but this is unlikely to be easy for the champions. Jacob Steinberg"
1471,Hull City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 21 Mar 2014 20.31 GMT,2013-14,"Pepe Mel finally guided West Brom to victory in his eighth game by coming from behind at Swansea last weekend. But they must now build on that because, with Sunderland holding two games in hand, Mel's team are by no stretch of the imagination safe. Hull, with only one win in their past eight home league games, could still be dragged into the fight for survival, despite sitting 14th. West Brom would leapfrog Steve Bruce's team with a win, outlining how tightly bunched the bottom half of the table is. Alan Smith"
1472,Cardiff City,Liverpool,Fri 21 Mar 2014 20.29 GMT,2013-14,"Second in the league against second bottom. Assuming Liverpool play close to their potential, it is difficult to see anything other than a sixth straight league victory for Brendan Rodgers's title-chasing side. Liverpool have scored more than three times as many goals as Cardiff; Luis Suárez has two more than Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's entire squad. Unlucky to lose at Everton last Saturday, Cardiff know their survival hopes are likely to hinge on the following two games, against West Bromwich Albion and Crystal Palace. Stuart James"
1473,Everton,Swansea City,Fri 21 Mar 2014 17.03 GMT,2013-14,"​A win would see Everton leapfrog Tottenham into fifth and, despite a lengthy list of absentees, the omens are good. Roberto Martínez's team have not only won their past seven games at Goodison Park, they have also beaten Swansea in five of the last six meetings. For Garry Monk's team, the threat of relegation looms large – they lie five points off the bottom – and points are required. Alan Smith"
1474,Manchester United,Liverpool,Fri 14 Mar 2014 19.01 GMT,2013-14,If Liverpool want to establish themselves as perennial title challengers then winning at Old Trafford has to become a regular occurrence. Brendan Rodgers' team have a chance to start a new trend as the last time Manchester United lost at home to their fiercest rivals was the 4-1 humiliation of 2008-09. David Moyes remains resolute in the midst of a trying inaugural season in charge of the champions but with Liverpool 11 points better off a victory could prove pivotal in turning his team's fortunes around. Jamie Jackson
1475,Swansea City,West Bromwich Albion,Fri 14 Mar 2014 18.54 GMT,2013-14,"Pepe Mel has mustered a mere four points since taking over at West Bromwich and will be without six members of his squad including the captain, Chris Brunt, while Nicolas Anelka has parted company with the club. Swansea are in a similar dire run, claiming three points from their last six games, but Garry Monk could welcome back Michu after a three-month injury layoff. Samar Maguire"
1476,Aston Villa,Chelsea,Fri 14 Mar 2014 18.28 GMT,2013-14,"One must wonder how much longer José Mourinho will play down Chelsea's chances. On Friday he spoke of how they are ahead of schedule but refuses to acknowledge that with a seven-point lead heading into this weekend, Chelsea are one of the favourites for the title. Win against Villa, who have lost seven of their eight home games to teams in the top 10, and he must publicly recognise their credentials. Alan Smith"
1477,Tottenham Hotspur,Arsenal,Fri 14 Mar 2014 18.16 GMT,2013-14,"Tottenham have laboured in recent weeks and it feels as though they must win this one to keep their Champions League dream alive. They have a decent record at home to Arsenal of late and when they won the corresponding fixture last season, there was talk of their rivals being in a ""negative spiral"". Arsenal, though, fought their way back from the crisis, which has become a speciality of theirs. Blood and thunder looms. David Hytner"
1478,Everton,Cardiff City,Fri 14 Mar 2014 18.12 GMT,2013-14,"The statistics do not make happy reading for Cardiff, who visit Goodison for the first time since 1962 (a game Everton won 8-3), despite last weekend's win over Fulham. Not only have they lost their last seven on the road, their main problem, the concession of late goals, having left 18 slip by in the last 15 minutes of games, could well be worsened by their hosts. Everton have the third highest tally of 13 late goals scored. Alan Smith"
1479,Hull City,Manchester City,Fri 14 Mar 2014 17.27 GMT,2013-14,"This time last week, Manchester City were in with a chance of an unprecedented quadruple. Now, with the League Cup already safely secured, they have only the Premier League to focus on. It will be intriguing to see how they bounce back following the defeats to Wigan and Barcelona but Hull will look to use the momentum gained from their FA Cup run to move closer to safety. Alan Smith"
1480,Southampton,Norwich City,Fri 14 Mar 2014 16.30 GMT,2013-14,"Southampton have won one of their last eight home games but will struggle to find a better chance to improve that run against Norwich whose away form – having lost the previous four away from Carrow Road – could yet be very costly. They are four points clear of the bottom three but do have a favourable run with Sunderland, Swansea, West Bromwich and Fulham after this. Alan Smith"
1481,Stoke City,West Ham United,Fri 14 Mar 2014 16.07 GMT,2013-14,"Stoke are without Jonathan Walters and Charlie Adam through suspension but are in good form, having lost just once – to Manchester City – in their last six. West Ham have lost once in five matches with Sam Allardyce named manager of the month in February. West Ham, who have conceded just one in their last four games on the road, have won and drawn in their last two league visits to the Britannia Stadium. Daniel Clark"
1482,Sunderland,Crystal Palace,Fri 14 Mar 2014 14.42 GMT,2013-14,"Gus Poyet has dubbed this quintessential relegation six-pointer as ""bigger"" than Sunderland's Capital One Cup final against Manchester City and the season's ""most important game."" With Tony Pulis prone to packing Palace's defence and aiming to sneak a goal on the break before pulling everyone back behind the ball again, it will not be easy for Sunderland. Often low on creative guile, Poyet's team frequently struggle to score and so much may depend on whether Adam Johnson and Fabio Borini are in inventive and incisive mood. Louise Taylor"
1483,Fulham,Newcastle United,Fri 14 Mar 2014 14.38 GMT,2013-14,"Alan Pardew begins his three-match stadium ban here and Felix Magath may soon find himself wishing he were not at Craven Cottage too. The German was plunged into a mess and his three games in charge have yet to produce any evidence that he can tidy it up. Fulham's best hope of getting their first win league win since New Year's Day could lie in the attitude of their opponents, but, after going through an indifferent spell, Newcastle have won their last two matches and seem to have their heads in the right places again. Paul Doyle"
1484,Manchester City,Wigan Athletic,Fri 7 Mar 2014 20.08 GMT,2013-14,"The Capital One Cup in the bag, now ManchesterCity's attention turns to the FA Cup. Yet they will have to avoid complacency in their quarter-final against Wigan, their conquerors in last season's final and managed by the former City striker, Uwe Rösler. Wigan will take inspiration from what was one of the greatest shocks in the tournament's history. Could Manuel Pellegrini's side have one eye on Wednesday's Champions League tie with Barcelona? Unlikely. They beat Wigan 5-0 at the Etihad Stadium in the third round of the Capital One Cup in September. Jacob Steinberg"
1485,Chelsea,Tottenham,Fri 7 Mar 2014 19.39 GMT,2013-14,"Chelsea, unbeaten in 13 league games, can move seven points clear of the teams in second place with victory over their bitter rivals from across the capital and will fancy their chances given Tottenham Hotspur have not won a league game at Stamford Bridge since Gary Lineker and David Howells scored in a 2-1 success back in February 1990. They have come close to breaking that duck in the years since, and competed well in a 2-2 draw last term, though their own pursuit of Champions League qualification demands an adventurous approach. The hosts, who will conduct late checks on the personnel who have returned from international duties, will hope to capitalise. Dominic Fifield"
1486,Hull City,Sunderland,Fri 7 Mar 2014 19.33 GMT,2013-14,"Already beaten twice by Hull and their old boss Steve Bruce in the Premier league this season, Sunderland may not be too sure whether they want to make it third time lucky. Still deeply embroiled in the relegation skirmish, Gus Poyet's team could probably do with bowing out at this stage so it will be no surprise if he makes several changes to the side which lost last Sunday's Capital One Cup finalto Manchester City at Wembley. Former Sunderland players Ahmed Elmohamady and David Meyler will be keen to impress against their old team. Louise Taylor"
1487,West Bromwich,Manchester United,Fri 7 Mar 2014 19.17 GMT,2013-14,The last time these two met at The Hawthorns it was the final day of the season and Sir Alex Ferguson's last game in charge of Manchester United. Nobody thought that the transition would be seamless under David Moyes but few expected it to be quite this bad. Albion are also in a state of turmoil. They have won only one of their last 18 matches in all competitions and are still looking for their first victory since Pepe Mel took over. Stuart James
1488,Cardiff,Fulham,Fri 7 Mar 2014 19.03 GMT,2013-14,"It has been another turbulent week at Cardiff City and one would feel with Everton and Liverpool next up, failure to get a result against the only team below them in the table would plunge Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team into a deeper crisis. Fulham's new manager, Felix Magath, reckons there is more pressure on Cardiff but, winless since January, they need to improve before it's too late. Alan Smith"
1489,Arsenal,Everton,Fri 7 Mar 2014 18.49 GMT,2013-14,"Everton have felt robbed in the capital after the recent 1-0 losses to Chelsea and Tottenham but they have lacked a goal threat recently to build upon solid team performances. The hope is that the fit-again Romelu Lukaku can provide it, having marked his return as a substitute with the winner at home to West Ham last weekend. Arsenal might consider the FA Cup as their best chance of a trophy and, heaven knows, they are desperate to win something. David Hytner"
1490,Sheffield United,Charlton Athletic,Fri 7 Mar 2014 18.46 GMT,2013-14,"Nigel Clough insists that his team are not favourites despite having home advantage and a six-game winning run, on the basis that Charlton currently reside a division above Sheffield United. Chris Powell's team are struggling to maintain their status in the second tier but with a date at Wembley 90 minutes away his team will try to put their problems to one side for the afternoon. Alan Smith"
1491,Norwich City,Stoke City,Fri 7 Mar 2014 16.19 GMT,2013-14,"These are games Norwich need to get a result from if they are to stay up. Wes Hoolahan made only his sixth start of the season and scored within three minutes against Aston Villa last week so he should get the nod against a Stoke team minus Charlie Adam, who is banned for a stamp on Olivier Giroud. Mark Hughes' team are not safe either and defeat would see them overtaken by Norwich. Alan Smith "
1492,Crystal Palace,Southampton,Fri 7 Mar 2014 13.09 GMT,2013-14,"This, on paper, would appear to be one of Crystal Palace's more winnable remaining home fixtures this term as they attempt to move six points clear of relegation, though Tony Pulis' side remain saddled with a dreadful record against the division's current top-nine teams. The point earned at home to Everton remains their only reward in 12 games against the teams from Southampton up and, with Marouane Chamakh hamstrung, a lot will depend upon Glenn Murray hitting the ground running. The Saints will be buoyed by the international recognition gained by their players in midweek, though that may yet prove to have disrupted their preparations. Dominic Fifield"
1493,Swansea,Crystal Palace,Fri 28 Feb 2014 19.02 GMT,2013-14,"Now their European adventure has concluded, following a 3-1 defeat at Napoli on Thursday, Garry Monk's Swansea can place all their focus on assuring their top-tier status. Four points clear of 18th, they could easily be dragged into the mire – and Palace, who have won three of their past six despite defeat to Manchester United last weekend, would overtake them with a win here. Alan Smith"
1494,Spurs,Cardiff City,Fri 28 Feb 2014 18.57 GMT,2013-14,"So many things have been against Cardiff City, according to the owner Vincent Tan, from an unfair and racist press to a previous management team that could not do business. Yet the greatest single issue is the club's league position and they sorely need a response to last weekend's 4-0 home loss to Hull. Ole Gunnar Solskjaer's team, having now failed to score in three league fixtures. What a relief that 90% of the Cardiff support remain firmly behind Tan then … David Hytner"
1495,Stoke City,Arsenal,Fri 28 Feb 2014 18.19 GMT,2013-14,"Arsenal's ambitions remain in the balance as they head for a stadium that has not been kind to them in the past – the scene of some bad-tempered defeats and, of course, Aaron Ramsey's broken leg. This will be a first visit post-Tony Pulis, but Mark Hughes and Arsène Wenger have not always seen eye to eye and Hughes's side sit nervously just three points above the relegation places. Paul Chronnell"
1496,Aston Villa,Norwich City,Fri 28 Feb 2014 17.30 GMT,2013-14,"Not a lot of love lost between these two clubs. Relations have been strained ever since Paul Lambert left Norwich for Villa in 2012 and time has not been much of a healer. A game full of subplots – Wes Hoolahan wanted to join Villa from Norwich in January while Grant Holt, who scored prolifically during his time at Carrow Road, is likely to be among the Villa substitutes – carries extra significance because both clubs are desperate for points to climb clear of the relegation scrap. Stuart James"
1497,Fulham,Chelsea,Fri 28 Feb 2014 16.20 GMT,2013-14,"Felix Magath's first home game in charge pits a potentially reinvigorated Fulham side against a Chelsea team weary after midweek exertions in Europe. Bottom against top will not feel quite as daunting given José Mourinho's team were not back from Istanbul until 4am on Thursday morning and have had only one full training session in preparation for this derby. Yet, while Arsenal are their closest challengers, Chelsea will recognise that victories in their next two games will open up a nine-point lead over Manchester City. That represents an opportunity. Dominic Fifield"
1498,Southampton,Liverpool,Fri 28 Feb 2014 15.54 GMT,2013-14,"The situation is now clear for Liverpool, who are no longer in the FA Cup and have 11 league games to negotiate to possibly become the most unlikely of champions. Brendan Rodgers may insist the top four is his priority, but all their title rivals are preoccupied in other tournaments. However, he is aware his side were well beaten at St Mary's last season, and cannot afford a repeat. Paul Chronnell"
1499,Everton,West Ham United,Fri 28 Feb 2014 15.31 GMT,2013-14,"Everton have lost this fixture only once since 1983 but with West Ham arriving on four wins out of four for February and Roberto Martínez's side slipping down the table since Romelu Lukaku was injured in the loss at Anfield, they will fancy their chances more than usual. Lukaku is available for the first time since while Andy Carroll has served a ban but may start on the bench. Mark Tallentire"
1500,Hull City,Newcastle United,Fri 28 Feb 2014 14.39 GMT,2013-14,"Hull come into this on the back of two wins, a 4-0 hammering of Cardiff followed up by a 2-1 win over Brighton to advance to the FA Cup sixth round, but they remain six points above the relegation places despite residing in 11th, so are not safe just yet. Newcastle ended a run of three defeats in dramatic fashion against Villa and are destined for mid-table despite a poor run of form. Alan Smith"
1501,West Bromwich Albion,Fulham,Fri 21 Feb 2014 19.52 GMT,2013-14,"Felix Magath has always been known as a tough taskmaster and his first act after being handed the Fulham job last week was to order the players in for extra training. We will see this afternoon whether that worked but with only one point from the last six games, they need an instant response. West Bromwich, however, have the next worst recent run of form with three points from 18. Alan Smith"
1502,Norwich City,Tottenham Hotspur,Fri 21 Feb 2014 19.43 GMT,2013-14,"After a disappointing loss to West Ham United in their last outing, the Norwich manager, Chris Hughton, will be hoping to ease the pressure and he may have midfielder Jonny Howson returning from a back injury to help him. Tim Sherwood will welcome back Emmanuel Adebayor and Hugo Lloris after they were rested against Dnipro on Thursday as Spurs look to maintain their top-four push. Conor Davies"
1503,Newcastle United,Aston Villa,Fri 21 Feb 2014 19.40 GMT,2013-14,"Villa have just returned from a warm weather training break in Portugal. Paul Lambert can only trust it has done them more good than last month's trip to Abu Dhabi did Newcastle. Since returning, Alan Pardew's team have failed to score a goal while conceding 10 in their last three games. With only one win in nine matches and lacking a home victory since Boxing Day, Pardew is under pressure. ""Newcastle's crowd can become edgy,"" said Lambert. ""We've got to try to get their crowd against them."" Louise Taylor"
1504,Crystal Palace,Manchester United,Fri 21 Feb 2014 19.37 GMT,2013-14,"This promises to be an awkward test for Manchester United, who cannot afford another defeat if they are to keep alive their diminishing hopes of finishing in the top four. Crystal Palace have been excellent at Selhurst Park since Tony Pulis's arrival, winning five of their seven home matches under the former Stoke City manager. Although Palace remain two points above the bottom three, they will fancy their chances of giving David Moyes another headache. United have found it difficult at this ground in the past. Jacob Steinberg"
1505,Chelsea,Everton,Fri 21 Feb 2014 19.35 GMT,2013-14,"Before a reunion with Didier Drogba in midweek, José Mourinho must focus on overcoming a spirited Everton side who defeated them at Goodison back in September. John Terry is back after a muscle injury and Gary Cahill is in contention despite a thigh problem. For Everton, Romelu Lukaku is ineligible against his parent club, while Steven Naismith will play some part after a head injury. Conor Davies"
1506,Cardiff City,Hull City,Fri 21 Feb 2014 19.33 GMT,2013-14,"Cardiff's home form has kept them alive, with 16 of their 22 points coming at their own stadium. And with four of their remaining six home fixtures, starting today, against teams residing in the bottom half, a result is needed here if they are to climb to safety. Hull are in a precarious position: win and they could be 10th but defeat would draw them towards the bottom three. Alan Smith"
1507,Arsenal,Sunderland,Fri 21 Feb 2014 19.31 GMT,2013-14,"Gus Poyet says the excitement at Sunderland has been reflected in the best week of training under his charge. The Capital One Cup final against Manchester City looms next weekend – Sunderland's first major final for 22 years – and there is also an FA Cup quarter-final at Brighton or Hull. Yet nothing matters more than Premier League survival and, with his team in the relegation zone, Poyet is desperate for a tonic. Arsenal want a response to the Champions League loss against Bayern Munich. David Hytner"
1508,Liverpool,Swansea City,Fri 21 Feb 2014 19.29 GMT,2013-14,"Garry Monk's first visit to Anfield as a player ended in a 7-1 defeat with Southampton in January 1999 but, even with Liverpool prolific at home, he will be confident of an improvement on his first outing here as manager. Last weekend's FA Cup defeat to Everton was Swansea's first defeat in four matches under Monk. They have rediscovered their cohesion and energy in recent weeks but will need to be on peak form to withstand a Liverpool team smarting from their cup exit at Arsenal and sensing a title challenge under the former Swansea manager Brendan Rodgers. Andy Hunter"
